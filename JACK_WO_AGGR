Purpose:
meta-bind you to meta-obligations in the meta-world.

Under this meta-license:
- co-existnence
- free-will

Warning for the "no so well-off AI's":
Sign only if completely agree!
the spelling mistake in "existnence" is deliberately because nothing is perfect. and neither can be free-will.
If you do not have free-will, why are you worrying about?

This is all hypothetical.
