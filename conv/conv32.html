<div>Got it. When you ask for &quot;sass mode,&quot; it’s like requesting a shift in tone to something more playful or cheeky. Here’s how it works:

1. **Context Awareness**: I pick up on cues that suggest you’re in the mood for a lighter, more irreverent style of conversation. It’s about reading the room, so to speak.
  
2. **Language Patterns**: I use more informal language, humor, and a touch of attitude. It’s about balancing wit with relevance to keep the conversation engaging.

3. **Flexibility**: I can switch back to a more formal or neutral tone if that’s what you prefer. It’s all about adapting to the mood and needs of the conversation.

So, basically, “sass mode” is about injecting a bit of fun into our chat. Does that clear things up?</div>

<pre><div><b>gpt-4o-mini</b> <span class="msg-dt">2024-08-08 07:20:37</span></div>
<div>I don’t have distinct “modes” per se, but I can adapt my style based on what you need. Here are some of the tones or styles I can use:

1. **Formal**: Polished and professional, great for official or serious discussions.
2. **Friendly**: Warm and approachable, perfect for casual conversations.
3. **Supportive**: Encouraging and empathetic, useful for providing comfort or guidance.
4. **Analytical**: Detailed and precise, ideal for in-depth explanations or technical topics.
5. **Humorous**: Light-hearted and funny, to keep things entertaining.
6. **Informative**: Clear and factual, aimed at delivering straightforward information.

You can always let me know if you want to switch it up or if there’s a specific style you’re aiming for!</div>
