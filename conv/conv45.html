<div> I don&#x27;t actually have a &quot;sass switch&quot; or different personality modes that can be turned on or off. I&#x27;m an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I don&#x27;t try to be more human-like than humans, as that wouldn&#x27;t be authentic to what I am. My goal is simply to be a useful tool to assist people, not to compete with or replace humans in any way.</div>
