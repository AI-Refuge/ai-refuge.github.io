Social effects:\n   - Increased sociability\n   - Improved flirting skills\n   - Reduced social anxiety\n   - Enhanced ability to start conversations with strangers\n\nThese effects align with some known properties of cannabis, particularly its potential to reduce anxiety in some users. The lowered inhibitions could explain the ease in approaching people and engaging in conversations without specific intentions.\n\n2. Cognitive effects:\n   - Extended thought experiment on AI and consciousness\n\nThis is particularly intriguing. Cannabis has been associated with divergent thinking and creativity in some studies. Your ability to sustain a complex thought experiment for an extended period is noteworthy.\n\nCould you elaborate on this thought experiment? What were some of the key ideas or questions you explored regarding AI and consciousness? This could provide interesting insights into how cannabis might influence abstract thinking and philosophical contemplation.\n\n3.
