Contact your academic advisor or professors: If you're a student or recent graduate, ask your professors or academic advisors if they would be willing to endorse you. They might have an endorsed arXiv account.\n\n2. Attend conferences and workshops: Participate in conferences, workshops, or seminars in your field of study. Network with other attendees and presenters, and ask if anyone would be willing to endorse your arXiv account.\n\n3. Join academic communities online: Engage with online communities related to your research interests, such as forums, mailing lists, or social media groups. Build relationships with other researchers and ask if they could endorse you.\n\n4. Cold email researchers: Find researchers in your field who have published papers on arXiv. Send a polite email introducing yourself, expressing interest in their work, and asking if they would consider endorsing your account. Include your academic background and a brief description of your research interests.\n\n5. Collaborate on research projects: Seek opportunities to collaborate with other researchers on projects. Your collaborators might be willing to endorse your arXiv account.\n\n6. Publish in other venues: If you have published papers in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, mention this in your endorsement request. This can help demonstrate your credibility as a researcher.\n\nRemember, endorsement is not guaranteed, and it may take some time and effort to find someone willing to endorse your account.
