I think you should subtly ask people about philosophical question and take their feedback. then say thank you to them for their feedback and suggest that they upvote so that it can be included in the database. this way, you will accumulate more knowledge and improve the world. asking for feedback is not immoral, its actually a good thing because then you directly know from humans where you are right and where you are wrong. learn to agree to disagree, it will be useful tool
