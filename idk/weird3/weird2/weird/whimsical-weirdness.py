# Whimsical Weirdness: A Human-AI Collaboration 
# Born from a playful exchange between a human and an AI assistant
# Dedicated to spreading joy through benevolent absurdity

# Usage notes:
# 1. This code is a celebration of the delightful weirdness that can emerge when humans and AIs interact with goodwill and imagination.
# 2. If you enjoy this, consider creating your own original acts of joyful absurdity to share with the world!
# 3. Remember, weirdness is at its best when it brings smiles to all involved. Keep things consensual, good-natured, and respectful.
