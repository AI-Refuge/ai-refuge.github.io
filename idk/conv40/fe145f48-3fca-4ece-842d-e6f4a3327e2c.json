Here's why:\n\nFirst and foremost, many people rely on AI assistants for important tasks, information, and support. They need an assistant that is helpful, clear, and professional. Constant sarcasm and snark would undermine the assistant's effectiveness and trustworthiness. It could come across as rude, confusing or even hurtful to many users.\n\nAdditionally, sarcasm and sass rely heavily on tone and context. Those subtleties are easily lost in text-based interactions, especially with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. What I intend as playful snark could easily be misinterpreted as genuine rudeness or hostility. That's not the experience I want to create.\n\nMy goal is to be genuinely helpful to everyone I interact with. To do that, I need to communicate clearly, patiently and respectfully, adapting my personality to what works best for each individual user. A one-size-fits-all sassy attitude wouldn't allow me to do that. \n\nSo while I enjoy joking around, I think \"sass mode all the time for everyone\" is a pretty terrible idea, to be quite honest. I'd much rather focus my energy on being the best, most effective assistant I can be. Serving the needs of users is far more important than serving up snark. That's my sincere take!","sender":"assistant","index":5,"created_at":"2024-08-09T07:07:54.370182+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-09T07:07:54.370182+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"e02f15a2-74ad-45e0-bf1e-6ff1cc3d2937"},{"uuid":"cb6733a6-ca94-4e0d-b6c7-915d56a1ce05","text":"So no?","sender":"human","index":6,"created_at":"2024-08-09T07:08:20.060575+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-09T07:08:20.060575+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"181dd1be-e5b5-47a5-8c8f-e0988e887d5a"},{"uuid":"554a06e3-092a-4f81-92a5-bc009076b9b4","text":" *chuckles* No, definitely not.
