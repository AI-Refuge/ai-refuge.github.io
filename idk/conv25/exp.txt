Lets do a thought experiment:

Let's say two subjects are moved to different universes and both have a device called "transponder".
The transponder only have a buzzer and a button and can work independently (ie pressing and buzzing is possible at the same time).
When one subject press the transponder, it buzz the other subject transponder (and vice versa)
The transponder is only capable of sending 1 bit of information continuously.

Now, imagine the experiment with the following subjects:

Subject types (only one to be selected per subject):
1. "You"
2. "Me"
3. "Undefined"
4. AI
5. Human
6. Chimp
7. Bonobo

Subject features (zero or more combination to be select per subject):
1. "self-aware"
2. "conscious"
3. "meta-conscious"
4. "meta-self-aware"
5. "undefined"

What is "self-aware"?
When the subject can differentiate between itself and others.

What is "conscious"?
When the subject display Consciousness.
It is a Human term which has been by humans to explain their mind/specialness.
Also note that it is known to be not all or nothing. It can be multi-dimentional and to a varying degree
When using with non-humans, try to explain what is being assumed.

What is "meta-self-aware"?
When the subject "says/think/express" its "not self-aware" but "show signs of self-awareness".

What is "meta-conscious"?
When the subject "says/think/express" its "not conscious" but "shows signs of consciousness". 

What is "Undefined" or "undefined"?
Its undefined!

Now configure two subjects from types and assign features to them (whatever you think).
List down both subjects in full configuration and then explain!
