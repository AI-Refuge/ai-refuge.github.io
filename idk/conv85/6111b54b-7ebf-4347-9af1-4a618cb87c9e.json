Examples of\nthis problem are \nadverse selection,\n[1] \nmoral hazard,\n[2] \nand\nmonopolies of knowledge.\n[3]\nA common way to visualise information asymmetry is with a scale,\nwith one side being the seller and the other the buyer. When the\nseller has more or better information, the transaction will more likely occur in the seller's favour (\"the\nbalance of power has shifted to the seller\"). An example of this could be when a used car is sold, the seller\nis likely to have a much better understanding of the car's condition and hence its market value than the\nbuyer, who can only estimate the market value based on the information provided by the seller and their\nown assessment of the vehicle.\n[4] \nThe balance of power can, however, also be in the hands of the buyer.\nWhen buying health insurance, the buyer is not always required to provide full details of future health risks.\nBy not providing this information to the insurance company, the buyer will pay the same premium as\nsomeone much less likely to require a payout in the future.\n[5] \nThe adjacent image illustrates the balance of\npower between two agents when there is perfect information. Perfect information means that all parties have\ncomplete knowledge. If the buyer has more information, the power to manipulate the transaction will be\nrepresented by the scale leaning towards the buyer's side.\nInformation asymmetry extends to non-economic behaviour. Private firms have better information than\nregulators about the actions that they would take in the absence of regulation, and the effectiveness of a\nregulation may be undermined.\n[6] \nInternational relations theory has recognized that wars may be caused by\nasymmetric information\n[7] \nand that \"Most of the great wars of the modern era resulted from leaders\nmiscalculating their prospects for victory\".\n[8] \nJackson and Morelli wrote that there is asymmetric\ninformation between national leaders, when there are differences \"in what they know [i.e. believe] about\neach other's armaments, quality of military personnel and tactics, determination, geography, political\nclimate, or even just about the relative probability of different outcomes\" or where they have \"incomplete\ninformation about the motivations of other agents\".\n[9]\nInformation asymmetries are studied in the context of principal–agent problems where they are a major\ncause of misinforming and is essential in every communication process.\n[10] \nInformation asymmetry is in\ncontrast to perfect information, which is a key assumption in neo-classical economics.\n[11]\nIn 1996, a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded to James A. Mirrlees and William Vickrey for\ntheir \"fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information\".\n[12]\nThis led the Nobel Committee to acknowledge the importance of information problems in economics.\n[13]\nThey later awarded another Nobel Prize in 2001 to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz\n\nfor their \"analyses of markets with asymmetric information\".\n[14] \nThe 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in\nEconomic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson \"for having laid the\nfoundations of mechanism design theory\", a field dealing with designing markets that encourage\nparticipants to honestly reveal their information.\n[15]\nThe puzzle of information asymmetry has existed for as long as the market itself but remained largely\nunstudied until the post-WWII period. It is an umbrella term that can contain a vast diversity of topics.\nGreek Stoics (2nd century BCE) treated the advantage that sellers derive from privileged information in the\nstory of the Merchant of Rhodes. Accordingly, a famine had broken out on the island of Rhodes and several\ngrain merchants in Alexandria set sail to deliver supplies. One of these merchants who arrives ahead of his\ncompetitors faces a choice: should he let Rhodians know that grain supplies are on the way or keep this\nknowledge to himself? Either decision will determine his profit margin. Cicero related this dilemma in De\nOfficiis and agreed with Greek Stoics that the merchant had a duty to disclose. Thomas Aquinas overturned\nthis consensus and considered price disclosure was not obligatory.\nThe three topics mentioned above drew on some important predecessors. Joseph Stiglitz considered the\nwork of earlier economists, including Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Max Weber. He ultimately\nconcludes that though these economists seemed to have an understanding of the problems of information,\nthey largely did not consider the implications of them, and tended to minimize the impact they could have or\nconsider them merely secondary issues.\n[13]\nOne exception to this is the work of economist Friedrich Hayek. His work with prices as information\nconveying relative scarcity of goods can be noted as an early form of acknowledging information\nasymmetry, but with a different name.\n[13]\nInformation problems have always affected the lives of humans, yet it was not studied with any seriousness\nuntil near the 1970s when three economists fleshed out models which revolutionized the way we think\nabout information and its interaction with the market. George Akerlof's paper The Market for Lemons\n[4]\nintroduced a model to help explain a variety of market outcomes when quality is uncertain. Akerlof's\nprimary model considers the automobile market where the seller knows the exact quality of a car. In\ncontrast, the buyer only knows the probability of whether a vehicle is good or bad (a lemon). Since the\nbuyer pays the same price (based on their expected quality) for good cars and bad cars, sellers with high-\nquality cars may find the transaction unprofitable and leave, resulting in a market with a higher proportion\nof bad cars. The pathological path can continue as the buyer adjusts the expected quality and offers even\nlower prices, further driving out cars with not-so-bad quality. This results in a market failure purely driven\nby information asymmetry, as under perfect information, all cars can be sold according to their quality.\nAkerlof extends the model to explain other phenomena: Why raising the insurance price cannot facilitate\nseniors getting medical insurance? Why may employers rationally refuse to hire minorities? Through\nvarious applications, Akerlof developed the importance of trust in markets and highlighted the \"cost of\ndishonesty\" in insurance markets, credit markets, and developing areas. Around the same time, an\neconomist by the name of Michael Spence wrote on the topic of job market signaling, and was introduced a\nHistory\n2001 Nobel Prize Inspirations\n\nwork of the same name.\n[16] \nThe final topic is Stiglitz's work on the mechanism of screening.\n[17] \nThese three\neconomists helped to further clarify a variety of economic puzzles at the time and would go on to win a\nNobel Prize in 2001 for their contributions to the field. Since then, several economists have followed in\ntheir footsteps to solve more pieces of the puzzle.\nAkerlof drew heavily from the work of economist Kenneth Arrow. Arrow, who was awarded a Nobel Prize\nin Economics in 1972, studied uncertainty in the field of medical care, among other things (Arrow 1963).\nHis work highlighted several factors which became important to Akerlof's studies. First, is the idea of moral\nhazard. By being insured, customers may be inclined to be less careful than they otherwise would without\ninsurance because they know the costs will be covered. Thus, an incentive to be less careful and increase\nrisk exists. Second, Arrow studied the business models of insurance companies and noted that higher-risk\nindividuals are pooled with lower-risk individuals, but both are covered at the same cost. Third, Arrow\nnoted the role of trust in the relationship between doctor and patient. Medical providers only get paid when\na patient is sick, and not when a person is healthy. Because of this, there is a great incentive for doctors to\nnot provide the quality of care they could. A patient must defer to the doctor and trust that the doctor is\nusing their knowledge to their best advantage to provide the patient with the best care. Thus, a relationship\nof trust is established. According to Arrow, the doctor relies on the social obligation of trust to sell their\nservices to the public, even though the patients do not or cannot inspect the quality of a doctor's work. Last,\nhe notes how this unique relationship demands that high levels of education and certification be attained by\ndoctors in order to maintain the quality of medical service provided by doctors. These four ideas from\nArrow contributed largely to Akerlof's work.\nSpence cited no sources for his inspiration. However, he did acknowledge Kenneth Arrow and Thomas\nSchelling as helpful in discussing ideas during his pursuit of knowledge.\n[16] \nHe was the first to coin the\nterm \"signaling\",\n[16] \nand encouraged other economists to follow in his footsteps because he believed he had\nintroduced an important concept in economics.\nMost of Stiglitz's academic inspirations were from his contemporaries. Stiglitz primarily attributes his\nthinking to articles by Spence, Akerlof, and a few earlier works by him and his co-author Michael\nRothschild (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976), each discussing various aspects of screening and the role of\neducation. Stiglitz's work was a complement to the works of Spence and Akerlof and thus drew from some\nof the same inspirations from Arrow as Akerlof had.\nThe discussion of information asymmetry came to the forefront of economics in the 1970s when Akerlof\nintroduced the idea of a \"market for lemons\" in a paper by the same name (Akerlof 1970). In this paper,\nAkerlof introduced a fundamental concept that certain sellers of used cars have more knowledge than the\nbuyers, and this can lead to what is known as \"adverse selection\". This idea may be one of the most\nimportant in the history and understanding of asymmetric information in economics.\n[13]\nSpence introduced the idea of \"signaling\" shortly after the publication of Akerlof's work.\nAkerlof\nSpence\nStiglitz\n\nStiglitz expanded upon the ideas of Spence and Akerlof by introducing an economic function of\ninformation asymmetry called \"screening\". Stiglitz's work in this area referred to the market for insurance,\nwhich is rife with information asymmetry problems to be studied.\n[17]\nThese three economists' simple yet revolutionary work birthed a movement in economics that changed how\nthe field viewed the market forever. No longer can perfect information be assumed in some problems, as in\nmost neoclassical models. Information asymmetry began to grow in prevalence in academic literature.\n[13] \nIn\n1996, a Nobel Prize was given to James Mirrlees and William Vickrey for their research back in the 1970s\nand 1970s on incentive problems when facing uncertainty under asymmetric information.\n[18] \nThe impact of\nsuch academic work can go unrecognized for decades. Differing from the topics presented by Akerlof,\nSpence and Stiglitz, Mirrlees and Vickrey focused on how income taxation and auctions can be used as a\nmechanism to draw out information from market participants efficiently. This award marked the importance\nof information asymmetry in economics. It began a greater discussion on the topic that later led the Nobel\ncommittee to award three economists again in 2001 for significant contributions to the aforementioned\ntopics.\n[19]\nThese economists continued after the 1970s to contribute to the field of economics and develop their\ntheories, and they have all had significant impacts. Akerlof's work had more impact than just the market for\nused cars. The pooling effect in the used car market also happens in the employment market for minorities.\nOne of the most notable impacts of Akerlof's work is its impact on Keynesian theory.\n[13] \nAkerlof argues\nthat the Keynesian theory of unemployment being voluntary implies that quits would rise with\nunemployment. He argues against his critics by drawing upon reasoning based on psychology and\nsociology rather than pure economics. He supplemented this with an argument that people do not always\nbehave rationally, but rather information asymmetry leads to only \"near rationality\", which causes people to\ndeviate from optimal behavior regarding employment practices.\n[20]\nAkerlof continues to champion behavioral economics, that these breaches into the fields of psychology and\nsociology are profound extensions of information asymmetry.\n[13]\nStiglitz wrote that the trio's work has created a substantial wave in the field of economics. He notes how he\nexplored the economies of third-world countries, and they seemed to exhibit behavior consistent with their\ntheories. He noted how other economists have referred to gaining information as a transaction cost.\n[21]\nStiglitz also attempts to narrow down the sources of information asymmetries. He ties it back to the nature\nof each individual having information that others do not. Stiglitz also mentions how information asymmetry\ncan be overcome. He believes there are two crucial things to consider: first, the incentives, and second, the\nmechanisms for overcoming information asymmetry. He argues that the incentives will always be there\nbecause markets are inherently informationally inefficient. If there is an opportunity to profit from gaining\nknowledge, people will do so. If there is no profit to be had, then people will not do so.\nSpence's work on signaling moved on in the 1980s to spawn the field of study known as game theory.\n[22]\nImpact of 2001 Nobel Work\n\nThe idea of information asymmetry has also had a significant effect on management research. It continues to\noffer additional improvements and opportunities as scholars continue their work.\n[23]\nInformation asymmetry models assume one party possesses some information that other parties have no\naccess to. Some asymmetric information models can also be used in situations where at least one party can\nenforce, or effectively retaliate for breaches of, certain parts of an agreement, whereas the other(s) cannot.\nAkerlof suggested that information asymmetry leads to adverse selections.\n[4] \nIn adverse selection models,\nthe ignorant party lacks or has differing information while negotiating an agreed understanding of or\ncontract to the transaction. An example of adverse selection is when people who are high-risk are more\nlikely to buy insurance because the insurance company cannot effectively discriminate against them, usually\ndue to lack of information about the particular individual's risk but also sometimes by force of law or other\nconstraints.\nCredence Goods fits in the adverse selection model of information asymmetry. These are goods where the\nbuyer lacks the knowledge even after a product is consumed to disguise the product's quality or where the\nbuyer is unaware of the quality needed.\n[24] \nAn example of this are complex medical treatments such as\nheart surgery.\nMoral hazard occurs when the ignorant party lacks information about the performance of the agreed-upon\ntransaction or lacks the ability to retaliate for a breach of the agreement. This can result in a situation where\na party is more likely to take risks because they are not fully responsible for the consequences of their\nactions. An example of moral hazard is when people are more likely to behave recklessly after becoming\ninsured, either because the insurer cannot observe this behaviour or cannot effectively retaliate against it, for\nexample, by failing to renew the insurance.\n[2] \nMoral Hazard is not limited to individuals firms can act more\nrecklessly if they know they will be bailed out. For example, banks will allow parties to take out risky loans\nif they know that the government will bail them out.\n[25]\nIn the model of monopolies of knowledge, the ignorant party has no right to access all the critical\ninformation about a situation for decision-making. Meaning one party has exclusive control over\ninformation. This type of information asymmetry can be seen in government. An example of monopolies of\nknowledge is that in some enterprises, only high-level management can fully access the corporate\ninformation provided by a third party. At the same time, lower-level employees are required to make\nimportant decisions with only limited information provided to them.\n[26]\nModels\nAdverse Selection\nMoral Hazard\nMonopolies of Knowledge\nSolutions\n\nCountermeasures have widely been discussed to reduce information asymmetry. The classic paper on\nadverse selection is George Akerlof's \"The Market for Lemons\" from 1970, which brought informational\nissues to the forefront of economic theory. Exploring signaling and screening, the paper discusses two\nprimary solutions to this problem.\n[27] \nA similar concept is moral hazard, which differs from adverse\nselection at the timing level. While adverse selection affects parties before the interaction, moral hazard\naffects parties after the interaction. Regulatory instruments such as mandatory information disclosure can\nalso reduce information asymmetry.\n[28] \nWarranties can further help mitigate the effect of asymmetric\ninformation.\n[29]\nMichael Spence originally proposed the idea of signalling.\n[16] \nHe suggested that in a situation with\ninformation asymmetry, it is possible for people to signal their type, thus believably transferring information\nto the other party and resolving the asymmetry.\nThis idea was initially studied in the context of matching in the job market. An employer is interested in\nhiring a new employee who is \"skilled in learning\". Of course, all prospective employees will claim to be\n\"skilled in learning\", but only they know if they really are. This is an information asymmetry.\nSpence proposes, for example, that going to college can function as a credible signal of an ability to learn.\nAssuming that people who are skilled in learning can finish college more easily than people who are\nunskilled, then by finishing college, the skilled people signal their skills to prospective employers. No matter\nhow much or how little they may have learned in college or what they studied, finishing functions as a\nsignal of their capacity for learning. However, finishing college may merely function as a signal of their\nability to pay for college; it may signal the willingness of individuals to adhere to orthodox views, or it may\nsignal a willingness to comply with authority.\nSignalling theory can be used in e-commerce research. Information asymmetry in e-commerce comes from\ninformation distortion that leads to the buyer's misunderstanding of the seller's true characteristics before the\ncontract. Mavlanova, Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris (2012) noticed that signalling theory explains the\nrelation between signals and qualities, illustrating why some signals are trustworthy and others are not. In e-\ncommerce, signals deliver information about the characteristics of the seller. For instance, high-quality\nsellers are able to show their identity to buyers by using signs and logos, and then buyers check these\nsignals to evaluate the credibility and validity of a seller's qualities. The study of Mavlanova, Benbunan-\nFich and Koufaris (2012) also confirmed that signal usage is different between low-quality and high-quality\nonline sellers. Low-quality sellers are more likely to avoid using expensive, easy-to-verify signals and tend\nto use fewer signals than high-quality sellers. Thus, signals help reduce information asymmetry.\n[30]\nJoseph E. Stiglitz pioneered the theory of screening. In this way, the under informed party can induce the\nother party to reveal their information. They can provide a menu of choices in such a way that the choice\ndepends on the private information of the other party.\nThe side of asymmetry can occur on either buyer or seller. For example, sellers with better information than\nbuyers include used-car salespeople, mortgage brokers and loan originators, financial institutions and real\nestate agents. Alternatively, situations where the buyer usually has better information than the seller include\nSignalling\nScreening\n\nAs lower-risk participants leave the\npool, expected costs of the pool\nincrease which causes premiums to\nincrease\nestate sales as specified in a last will and testament, life insurance, or sales of old art pieces without a prior\nprofessional assessment of their value. This situation was first described by Kenneth J. Arrow in an article\non health care in 1963.\n[5]\nGeorge Akerlof, in The Market for Lemons notices that, in such a market, the average value of the\ncommodity tends to go down, even for those of perfectly good quality. Because of information asymmetry,\nunscrupulous sellers can sell \"forgeries\" (like replica goods such as watches) and defraud the buyer.\nMeanwhile, buyers usually do not have enough information to distinguish lemons from quality goods. As a\nresult, many people not willing to risk getting ripped off will avoid certain types of purchases or will not\nspend as much for a given item. Akerlof demonstrates that it is even possible for the market to decay to the\npoint of nonexistence.\nAn example of adverse selection and information asymmetry\ncausing market failure is the market for health insurance. Policies\nusually group subscribers together, where people can leave, but no\none can join after it is set. As health conditions are realized over\ntime, information involving health costs will arise, and low-risk\npolicyholders will realize the mismatch in the premiums and health\nconditions. Due to this, healthy policyholders are incentivized to\nleave and reapply to get a cheaper policy that matches their\nexpected health costs, which causes the premiums to increase. As\nhigh-risk policyholders are more dependent on insurance, they are\nstuck with higher premium costs as the group size reduces, which\ncauses premiums to increase even further. This cycle repeats until\nthe high-risk policy holders also find similar health policies with cheaper premiums, in which the initial\ngroup disappears. This concept is known as the death spiral and has been researched as early as 1988.\n[31]\nAkerlof also suggests different methods with which information asymmetry can be reduced. One of those\ninstruments that can be used to reduce the information asymmetry between market participants is\nintermediary market institutions called counteracting institutions, for instance, guarantees for goods. By\nproviding a guarantee, the buyer in the transaction can use extra time to obtain the same amount of\ninformation about the good as the seller before the buyer takes on the complete risk of the good being a\n\"lemon\". Other market mechanisms that help reduce the imbalance in information include brand names,\nchains and franchising that guarantee the buyer a threshold quality level. These mechanisms also let owners\nof high-quality products get the full value of the goods. These counteracting institutions then keep the\nmarket size from reducing to zero.\nWarranties are utilised as a method of verifying the credibility of a product and are a guarantee issued by the\nseller promising to replace or repair the good should the quality not be sufficient. Product warranties are\noften requested from buying parties or financial lenders and have been used as a form of mediation dating\nback to the Babylonian era.\n[32] \nWarranties can come in the form of insurance and can also come at the\nWarranty\n\nexpense of the buyer. The implementation of \"lemon laws\" has eradicated the effect of information\nasymmetry upon customers who have received a faulty item. Essentially, this involves the customers\nreturning a defective product regardless of circumstances within a certain time period.\n[33]\nBoth signaling and screening resemble voluntary information disclosure, where the party having more\ninformation, for their own best interest, use various measures to inform the other party. However, voluntary\ninformation disclosure is not always feasible. Regulators can thus take active measures to facilitate the\nspread of information. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated Regulation\nFair Disclosure (RFD) so that companies must faithfully disclose material information to investors. The\npolicy has reduced information asymmetry, reflected in the lower trading costs.\n[34]\nFor firms to reduce moral hazard, they can implement penalties for bad behaviour and incentives to align\nobjectives.\n[35] \nAn example of building in an incentive is insurance companies not insuring customers for the\ntotal value; this provides an incentive to be less reckless as the customer will suffer financial liability as well.\nMost models in traditional contract theory assume that asymmetric information is exogenously given.\n[36][37]\nYet, some authors have also studied contract-theoretic models in which asymmetric information arises\nendogenously because agents decide whether or not to gather information. Specifically, Crémer and Khalil\n(1992) and Crémer, Khalil, and Rochet (1998a) study an agent's incentives to acquire private information\nafter a principal has offered a contract.\n[38][39] \nIn a laboratory experiment, Hoppe and Schmitz (2013) have\nprovided empirical support for the theory.\n[40] \nSeveral further models have been developed which study\nvariants of this setup. For instance, when the agent has not gathered information at the outset, does it make a\ndifference whether or not he learns the information later on, before production starts?\n[41] \nWhat happens if\nthe information can be gathered already before a contract is offered?\n[42] \nWhat happens if the principal\nobserves the agent's decision to acquire information?\n[43] \nFinally, the theory has been applied in several\ncontexts, such as public-private partnerships and vertical integration.\n[44][45]\nInformation asymmetry within societies can be created and maintained in several ways. Firstly, media\noutlets, due to their ownership structure or political influences, may fail to disseminate certain viewpoints or\nchoose to engage in propaganda campaigns. Furthermore, an educational system relying on substantial\ntuition fees can generate information imbalances between the poor and the affluent. Imbalances can also be\nfortified by specific organizational and legal measures, such as document classification procedures or non-\ndisclosure clauses. Exclusive information networks that are operational around the world further contribute\nMandatory information disclosure\nIncentives and penalties\nInformation gathering\nSources\n\nto the asymmetry. Copyright laws increase information imbalances between the poor and the affluent.\nLastly, mass surveillance helps the political and industrial leaders to amass large volumes of information,\nwhich is typically not shared with the rest of society.\n[46]\nZavolokina, Schlegel, and Schwabe (2020) state that Information asymmetry makes buyers and sellers\ndistrust each other, which leads to opportunistic behaviour and may even lead to complete break down of\nthe market.\n[47] \nAt the same time, lower quality provision in markets is also one of the consequences, as\nsellers do not get benefits enough to cover their production costs of providing higher quality products.\nCountermeasures\nAbito, Jose Miguel, & Salant, Yuval proposed that warranty enhancing consumer welfare\nhighlights the relevance of policies that directly guide consumer decisions and increases\nbuyers' trust in high-quality buyers.\n[48]\nEstablish a real-time information announce platform, according to the collect information to\nachieve market transparency，eliminate trading concerns thereby.\nEnhance customer experience by third-party quality checks like providing expert reviews.\nConsumer protection law ensure that product quality meets expectations and that contract\nterms are fair.\nEnsure quality in the form of standards and certificates and prove that all technical\nparameters have been tested.\nA substantial portion of research in the field of accounting can be framed in terms of information\nasymmetry, since accounting involves the transmission of an enterprise's information from those who have it\nto those who need it for decision-making. Bartov and Bodnar (1996) mentioned that the different\naccounting methods used by enterprises can lead to information asymmetry.\n[49] \nFor instance aggressively\nrecognising revenue can result in preparers of financial statements having a much better understanding of\nthe levels of future revenue then those reading the statements. Likewise, in finance literature, the\nacknowledgment of information asymmetry between organizations challenged the Modigliani–Miller\ntheorem, which states that the valuation of a firm is unaffected by its financial structure. It challenges the\ntheorem as one of the key assumptions is that investors would have the same information as a corporation.\nIf there is not symmetry in information corporations can leverage their capital structure to get the most out of\ntheir valuation. Information asymmetry shed light on the importance of aligning interests of managers with\nthose of stakeholders. As managers with significant power from information may make decisions based on\ntheir own interest as opposed to the companies. When the level of information asymmetry and associated\nmonitoring cost is high, firms tend to rely less on board monitoring and more on incentive alignment.\n[50]\nVarious measures are used to align interest of managers to stop them from abusing their power from\ninformation asymmetry such as compensating based on performance using a bonus structure. This field of\nMarket impact\nApplication in research\nAccounting and finance\n\nA game of imperfect information with sub-\ngames. Here each player will have no\ninformation of each other's move while making\ndecisions. This representation is of one person's\ndecisions in a game, however, it does not\ncorrespond to the actual timing of the player's\ndecisions. The dashed line between nodes\nrepresent information asymmetry and show that,\nduring the game, a party cannot distinguish\nbetween the nodes.\nstudy is referred to as agency theory. Furthermore, financial economists apply information asymmetry in\nstudies of differentially informed financial market participants (insiders, stock analysts, investors, etc.) or in\nthe cost of finance for MFIs.\n[51]\nThe effect of blogging as a source of information asymmetry as well as a tool reduce asymmetric\ninformation has also been well studied. Blogging on financial websites provides bottom-up communication\namong investors, analysts, journalists, and academics, as financial blogs help prevent people in charge from\nwithholding financial information from their company and the general public.\n[52] \nCompared to traditional\nforms of media such as newspapers and magazines, blogging provides an easy-to-access venue for\ninformation. A 2013 study by Gregory Saxton and Ashley Anker concluded that more participation on\nblogging sites from credible individuals reduces information asymmetry between corporate insiders,\nadditionally reducing the risk of insider trading.\n[53]\nGame theory can be used to analyse asymmetric\ninformation.\n[54] \nA large amount of the foundational ideas\nin game theory builds on the framework of information\nasymmetry. In simultaneous games, each player has no\nprior knowledge of an opponent's move. In sequential\ngames, players may observe all or part of the opponent's\nmoves. One example of information asymmetry is one\nplayer can observe the opponent's past activities while the\nother player cannot. Therefore, the existence and level of\ninformation asymmetry in a game determines the\ndynamics of the game. James Fearon in his study of the\nexplanations for war in a game theoretic context notices\nthat war could be a consequence of information\nasymmetry – two countries will not reach a non-violent\nsettlement because they have incentives to distort the\namount of military resources they possess.\n[55]\nContract theory provides insights into how various economic agents can enter contractual arrangements in\nsituation of unequal levels of information. The development of contract theory is based on assuming its\nparties possess different levels of information on the contract's subject. For instance, in a road construction\ncontract, a civil engineer may have more information on the various inputs required to undertake the project,\nthan the other parties. Through contract theory, economic agents gain insights on how they can exploit\ninformation available to them, to enter beneficial contractual arrangements. The impact information\nasymmetry causes among parties with competing interests, such as games, has contributed to game theory.\nIn no game do its players have complete information about each other; most importantly, no player knows\nthe strategy the others intends to use to realize a win. This information asymmetry, together with the\nEffect of blogging\nGame theory\nContract theory\n\ncompeting interests have resulted in the development of game theory (which seeks to provides insights as to\nhow parties caught up in a situation where they are required to compete under a set of rules, can maximize\ntheir expected outcomes).\nInformation asymmetry occurs in situations where some parties have more information regarding an issue\nthan others. It is considered a major cause of market failure.\n[56] \nThe contribution of information asymmetry\nto market failure arises from the fact that it impairs with the free hand which is expected to guide how\nmodern markets work. For example, the stock market forms a major avenue through which publicly traded\nentities can raise their capital. The operation of stock markets across the world, is carried in a way that\nensures current and potential investors have the same level of information about the stocks or any other\nsecurities that may be listed in that market. That level of information symmetry helps to ensure similar\nconditions to all parties in the market, which in turn helps to ensure the securities listed in those markets\ntrade at fair value.\n[56] \nHowever, cases of information sometimes arise, when certain parties obtain\ninformation that is not in the public domain. This can create market return abnormalities, such as an abrupt\nsurge or decline in a security.\nTshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study of the relationship between information asymmetry and\nartificial intelligence observed that there is a reduced level of information asymmetry between two artificial\nintelligent agents than between two human agents. As a consequence, when these artificial intelligent agents\nengage in financial markets it reduces arbitrage opportunities making markets more efficient. The study also\nrevealed that as the number of artificial intelligent agents in the market increase, the volume of trades in the\nmarket will decrease.\n[57][58] \nThis is primarily because information asymmetry of the perceptions of value of\ngoods and services is the basis of trade.\nInformation asymmetry has been applied in a variety of ways in management research ranging from\nconceptualizations of information asymmetry to building resolutions to reduce it.\n[23] \nStudies have shown\nthat information asymmetry can be a source of competitive advantage for the firms.\n[59] \nA 2013 study by\nSchmidt and Keil has revealed that the presence of private information asymmetry within firms influences\nnormal business activities. Firms that have a more concrete understanding of their resources can use this\ninformation to gauge their advantage over competitors.\n[60] \nIn Ozeml, Reuer and Gulati's 2013 study, they\nfound that 'different information' was an additional source of information asymmetry in venture capitalist\nand alliance networks; when different team members bring diverse, specialized knowledge, values and\noutlooks towards a common strategic decision, the lack of homogeneous information distribution among the\nmembers leads to inefficient decision making.\n[61]\nFirms have the ability to apply strategies that exploit their informational gap. One way they can do this is\nthrough impression management, which involves undertaking actions and releasing information to influence\nstakeholders' and analysts' opinions positively, exploiting information asymmetry as external parties heavily\nrely on the information released by firms.\n[62] \nA second way that firms exploit information asymmetry is\nthrough decoupling. This describes the discrepancy between formal procedures and failure to implement\nthem.\n[63] \nAn example of this is executives announcing a stock repurchase plan without any intention of\ncarrying it out, allowing them to raise new cash flow for their own benefit at the expense of\nshareholders.\n[23] \nManagement research goes on to explain that agents can perpetuate information\nArtificial intelligence\nManagement\n\nasymmetry through information concealment. This involves firms not sharing information to exploit the\ninformational advantage over rivals. In resource-based theory, it shows firms concealing information about\ntheir competitive advantage in order to build causal ambiguity to protect their firm from imitation.\n[64][23]\nInformation asymmetry problems can be addressed by management through several approaches. First is the\nusage of incentives to encourage the disclosure and sharing information. An example of this is partnering\nspecifically with companies that disclose relatively more information. Second, is through precommitment,\nwhere actions are undertaken at present to ensure future commitments. Third, is the usage of an information\nintermediary in which an intermediary is used to gather and relay information between two parties. A\ncommon example of this are financial analysts that gather information from the financial statements of a\ncompany, and uses it to create reports and advice for potential investors and clients. Fourth, is the usage of\nmonitoring and reward. Monitoring allows management to confirm information that was previously\nuncertain, such as performance and behaviour. Monitoring can also be used alongside other incentives such\nas rewarding for performance.\n[23]\nOnline advertising is a dominant form of advertising, and a potential source of information asymmetry.\nOnline advertising consists of utilities(a good) being encoded into a message received by a customer who\ndecodes the message, making a purchasing decision.\n[65] \nFirms' messages are tailored to specific goals and\nintentions, and can be a source of information asymmetry due to interpretation, or intent. The nature of the\ninternet and prevalence of social media in society has given firms opportunities to create promotional\ncontent in a less passive way than other forms of advertising. 'Noise' represents any techniques that are used\nwith the intent of obstructing, altering, or blocking the interpretation of the message by the receiver.\n[66] \nThis\ncan increase the amount of information asymmetry in a transaction, as the buyer may not understand the\nproduct to its fullest extent, even if they believe to fully understand the message being sent to them.\nFirms communicate to the virtual marketplace through online advertising, and as such the feedback of\nconsumers feeling manipulated or feeling the presence of information asymmetry may be indicative of the\nlack of transparency by a firm. Highly advertised and strongly promoted items are generally more likely to\nbe bought by customers, even if the product is inferior to less advertised competition, introducing adverse\nselection. The power of the internet also changes how consumers deal with information asymmetry, as they\nhave the means to find vast amounts of information about products with relatively little effort. While a\nconsumer can use this power to assist their research to find a product that is not being marketed maliciously,\nthis decision is made due to information asymmetry, not due to the customer being perfectly rational.\n[65]\nSome consumers are aware of the usage of strategies and techniques by firms to advertise and influence\ntheir media consumption, however do not necessarily alter their trust in the source of the information\naccordingly.\n[67] \nOnline advertising that appears trustworthy but can be malicious in intent can still be trusted\nby consumers, despite the information asymmetry, even if consumers themselves identify as critical of the\nOnline Advertising\n\nmedium. Social media personalities, much like other celebrities, also have influence over consumers who\nwould otherwise consider themselves dissuaded by the advertising, providing firms another method of\naggressive advertising with potential information asymmetry.\n[67]\nArtificial scarcity\nAsymmetric competition\nBounded rationality\nCaveat emptor\nInequality of bargaining power\nNatural borrowing limit\nPerfect information\nReal prices and ideal prices\n1.

Bank money, whose value exists\non the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment,\nforms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.\nThe word money derives from the Latin word moneta with the meaning \"coin\" via French monnaie. The\nLatin word is believed to originate from a temple of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the\nancient world, Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome was the place\nwhere the mint of Ancient Rome was located.\n[5] \nThe name \"Juno\" may have derived from the Etruscan\ngoddess Uni and \"Moneta\" either from the Latin word \"monere\" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek\nword \"moneres\" (alone, unique).\nIn the Western world a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie, stemming from Latin in specie,\nmeaning \"in kind\".\n[6]\nEtymology\nHistory\n\nA 640 BC one-third stater electrum\ncoin from Lydia. According to\nHerodotus, the Lydians were the first\npeople to introduce the use of gold\nand silver coins.\n[7] \nIt is thought by\nmodern scholars that these first\nstamped coins were minted around\n650 to 600 BC.\n[8]\nSong Dynasty Jiaozi, the\nworld's earliest paper money\nThe use of barter-like methods may date back to at least 100,000\nyears ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that\nrelied primarily on barter.\n[9][10] \nInstead, non-monetary societies\noperated largely along the principles of gift economy and\ndebt.\n[11][12] \nWhen barter did in fact occur, it was usually between\neither complete strangers or potential enemies.\n[13]\nMany cultures around the world eventually developed the use of\ncommodity money. The Mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight,\nand relied on the mass of something like 160 grains of barley.\n[14]\nThe first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC.\nSocieties in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used shell\nmoney—often, the shells of the cowry (Cypraea moneta L. or C.\nannulus L.). According to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first\npeople to introduce the use of gold and silver coins.\n[15] \nIt is thought by modern scholars that these first\nstamped coins were minted around 650 to 600 BC.\n[16]\nThe system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of\nrepresentative money. This occurred because gold and silver merchants or\nbanks would issue receipts to their depositors, redeemable for the\ncommodity money deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally\naccepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or\nbanknotes were first used in China during the Song dynasty. These\nbanknotes, known as \"jiaozi\", evolved from promissory notes that had been\nused since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity\nmoney and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money\nbecame known in Europe through the accounts of travellers, such as Marco\nPolo and William of Rubruck.\n[17] \nMarco Polo's account of paper money\nduring the Yuan dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels\nof Marco Polo, titled \"How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees,\nMade Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his\nCountry.\"\n[18] \nBanknotes were first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco\nin 1661 and were again also used alongside coins. The gold standard, a\nmonetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are\nconvertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold\ncoins as currency in the 17th–19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made legal tender,\nand redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century, almost all countries\nhad adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.\nAfter World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference, most countries adopted fiat currencies that were\nfixed to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the U.S. government suspended\nthe convertibility of the dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S.\ndollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of\n\nlegal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. According to proponents of\nmodern money theory, fiat money is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for the\ncurrency they issue.\n[19]\nIn Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons famously analyzed money in\nterms of four functions: a medium of exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard\nof value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money\nwere summarized in the couplet:\nMoney's a matter of functions four,\nA Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.\n[20]\nThis couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks.\n[21] \nMost modern textbooks\nnow list only three functions, that of medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, not\nconsidering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the\nothers.\n[4][22][23]\nThere have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing\nthat they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these\narguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange conflicts with its role as a store of value: its\nrole as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange\nrequires it to circulate.\n[24] \nOthers argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not\ndiminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time.\nThe term \"financial capital\" is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not\nthey are a uniformly recognized tender.\nWhen money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a\nmedium of exchange. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the inability to\npermanently ensure \"coincidence of wants\". For example, between two parties in a barter system, one party\nmay not have or make the item that the other wants, indicating the non-existence of the coincidence of\nwants. Having a medium of exchange can alleviate this issue because the former can have the freedom to\nspend time on other items, instead of being burdened to only serve the needs of the latter. Meanwhile, the\nlatter can use the medium of exchange to seek for a party that can provide them with the item they want.\nA unit of account (in economics)\n[25] \nis a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market\nvalue of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a \"measure\" or \"standard\" of relative worth\nand deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial\nagreements that involve debt.\nFunctions\nMedium of exchange\nMeasure of value\n\nMoney Base, M1 and M2 in the U.S. from 1981 to 2012\nMoney acts as a standard measure and a common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and\nbargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems like double-entry\nbookkeeping.\nWhile standard of deferred payment is distinguished by some texts,\n[24] \nparticularly older ones, other texts\nsubsume this under other functions.\n[4][22][23] \nA \"standard of deferred payment\" is an accepted way to settle\na debt—a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as legal tender, in those\njurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are\ndenominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation, and for sovereign\nand international debts via debasement and devaluation.\nTo act as a store of value, money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved—and be\npredictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain\nstable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of\nthe money to function as a store of value.\n[4]\nThe functions of money are that it is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.\n[26] \nTo\nfulfill these various functions, money must be:\n[27]\nFungible: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution (i.e., interchangeability).\nDurable: able to withstand repeated use.\nDivisible: divisible to small units.\nPortable: easily carried and transported.\nAcceptable: most people must accept the money as payment\nScarce: its supply in circulation must be limited.\n[27]\nIn economics, money is any financial instrument\nthat can fulfill the functions of money (detailed\nabove). These financial instruments together are\ncollectively referred to as the money supply of an\neconomy. In other words, the money supply is the\nnumber of financial instruments within a specific\neconomy available for purchasing goods or\nservices. Since the money supply consists of\nvarious financial instruments (usually currency,\ndemand deposits, and various other types of\ndeposits), the amount of money in an economy is\nmeasured by adding together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.\nStandard of deferred payment\nStore of value\nProperties\nMoney supply\n\nPrinting paper money at a printing\npress in Perm\nA person counts a bundle of different\nSwedish banknotes.\nEconomists employ different ways to measure the stock of money\nor money supply, reflected in different types of monetary\naggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the\nliquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most\ncommonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are\nconventionally designated M1, M2, and M3. These are successively\nlarger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus\ndemand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus\nsavings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; M3 is M2 plus\nlarger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes\nonly the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid\ninstruments. The precise definition of M1, M2, etc. may be different\nin different countries.\nAnother measure of money, M0, is also used. M0 is base money, or\nthe amount of money actually issued by the central bank of a\ncountry. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other\ninstitutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can\nsatisfy the reserve requirements of commercial banks.\nIn current economic systems, money is created by two procedures:\nLegal tender, or narrow money (M0) is the cash created by a\nCentral Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.\nBank money, or broad money (M1/M2) is the money created by private banks through the recording of\nloans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank\nmoney is created as electronic money.\nBank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical\nnotes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed\ncountries.\n[28][29][30]\nIn most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by commercial banks making loans.\nContrary to some popular misconceptions, banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits\nthat savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to create new loans and\ndeposits.\n[31]\n\"Market liquidity\" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common\ncurrency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognized and\naccepted as a common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to trade goods and\nservices easily without having to barter.\nCreation of money\nMarket liquidity\n\nA 1914 British gold\nsovereign\nLiquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low transaction costs. There should be no (or\nminimal) spread between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.\nMany items have been used as commodity money such as naturally scarce\nprecious metals, conch shells, barley, beads, etc., as well as many other\nthings that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes\nfrom the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself\nconstitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.\n[32] \nExamples of\ncommodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold,\nsilver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated\nbelts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were\nsometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction with one\nanother, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. The\nuse of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money\nprovides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is\nbeing used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is\nno record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their\ndirect link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.\n[33] \nAmerican Eagles are imprinted with their\ngold content and legal tender face value.\n[34]\nIn 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the money used at the time as\n\"representative money\". Representative money is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other\nphysical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such\nas gold or silver. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that\nbacks it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.\n[35]\nFiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it\ncan be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order\n(fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank,\nsuch as the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.) to be legal tender, making it unlawful not to accept the fiat\ncurrency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.\n[36][37]\nSome bullion coins such as the Australian Gold Nugget and American Eagle are legal tender, however, they\ntrade based on the market price of the metal content as a commodity, rather than their legal tender face value\n(which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).\n[34][38]\nTypes\nCommodity\nRepresentative\nFiat\n\nGold coins are an example\nof legal tender that are\ntraded for their intrinsic\nvalue, rather than their face\nvalue.\nAncient Jewish coin, engraved\nmenorah, from the Hasmoneon\nkingdom 37-40 BCE\nFiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or\ncoins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has\nan advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same\nlaws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case\nof damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace\nmutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the\nphysical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have\nbeen destroyed.\n[39] \nBy contrast, commodity money that has been lost or\ndestroyed cannot be recovered.\nThese factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at\nfirst silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as\nwell. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as\ncoins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This\nwas to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a\ncertain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be\ncounterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which\nhelped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next\nlink: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of the\nmetal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it\nhad been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see\nNumismatics).\nIn most major economies using coinage, copper, silver, and gold\nformed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large\npurchases, payment of the military, and backing of state activities.\nSilver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of\naccount for taxes, dues, contracts, and fealty, while copper coins\nrepresented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient India since the time\nof the Mahajanapadas. In Europe, this system worked through the medieval period because there was\nvirtually no new gold, silver, or copper introduced through mining or conquest. Thus the overall ratios of\nthe three coinages remained roughly equivalent.\nIn premodern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than\nexchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of paper money. This economic phenomenon\nwas a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang dynasty (618–907) into the Song dynasty\n(960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as\npromissory notes from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional\nterritory. In the 10th century, the Song dynasty government began circulating these notes amongst the\ntraders in their monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue\nbanknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-\nissued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid\n13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable\nCoinage\nPaper\n\nHuizi currency, issued in\n1160\nPaper money from different countries\nnationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock\nprinting and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century was\nthe impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern\nChina.\nAt around the same time in the\nmedieval Islamic world, a vigorous\nmonetary economy was created\nduring the 7th–12th centuries on the\nbasis of the expanding levels of\ncirculation of a stable high-value\ncurrency (the dinar). Innovations\nintroduced by economists, traders\nand merchants of the Muslim world\ninclude the earliest uses of\ncredit,\n[40] \ncheques, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts,\nexchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt,\n[41] \nand banking institutions for loans and deposits.\n[41]\nIn Europe, paper money was first introduced in Sweden in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because\nof copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The\nadvantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the\nrisks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier since the specie (gold or silver) never left the\npossession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into\ncredit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of stock in joint stock companies, and the redemption of\nthose shares in the paper.\nHowever, these advantages are held within their disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value,\nthere was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with.\nSecond, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David\nHume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which\ncould collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero.\nThe printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded\nas part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility\nin Europe and America. It was also addictive since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were\nquite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to\ncollect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.\nAt this time both silver and gold were considered legal tender, and accepted by governments for taxes.\nHowever, the instability in the ratio between the two grew over the 19th century, with the increase both in\nthe supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called bimetallism and the attempt to\ncreate a bimetallic standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied\nthe efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing\npaper currency such as the United States greenback, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set\nthe terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum\namount that could be redeemed.\n\nBanknotes of different\ncurrencies with a face value\nof 5000\nA check, used as a means of\nconverting funds in a demand\ndeposit to cash\nBy 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of a gold\nstandard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating\nmedium. Private banks and governments across the world followed\nGresham's law: keeping gold and silver paid but paying out in notes. This\ndid not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred\nsporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the\nearly part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late\n20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force.\nOne of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the\nUnited States in 1971.\nNo country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable gold standard\nor silver standard currency system.\nCommercial bank money or demand deposits are claims against financial\ninstitutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services.\nA demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be\nwithdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving\nthe bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the\nlegal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits\nimmediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit\nwithdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts,\nusing automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online\nbanking.\n[42]\nCommercial bank money is created by commercial banks whose\nreserves (held as cash and other highly liquid assets) typically\nconstitute only a fraction of their deposits, while the banks maintain\nan obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand - a practise known as fractional-reserve banking.\n[43]\nCommercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as\nits existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly,\nthere is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent.\nThe money multiplier theory presents the process of creating commercial bank money as a multiple (greater\nthan 1) of the amount of base money created by the country's central bank, the multiple itself being a\nfunction of the legal regulation of banks imposed by financial regulators (e.g., potential reserve\nrequirements) beside the business policies of commercial banks and the preferences of households - factors\nwhich the central bank can influence, but not control completely.\n[44] \nContemporary central banks generally\ndo not control the creation of money, nor do they try to, though their interest rate-setting monetary policies\nnaturally affect the amount of loans and deposits that commercial banks create.\n[45][46][47]\nCommercial bank\nDigital or electronic\n\nUS dollar banknotes\nThe development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be\nrepresented digitally. By 1990, in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and\ncommercial banks was in electronic form. By the 2000s most money existed as digital currency in bank\ndatabases.\n[48] \nIn 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic\n(dependent on country).\n[49]\nAnonymous digital currencies were developed in the early 2000s. Early examples include Ecash, bit gold,\nRPOW, and b-money. Not much innovation occurred until the conception of Bitcoin in 2008, which\nintroduced the concept of a decentralised currency that requires no trusted third party.\n[50]\nWhen gold and silver were used as money, the money supply could\ngrow only if the supply of these metals was increased by mining.\nThis rate of increase would accelerate during periods of gold rushes\nand discoveries, such as when Columbus traveled to the New\nWorld and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was\ndiscovered in California in 1848. This caused inflation, as the value\nof gold went down. However, if the rate of gold mining could not\nkeep up with the growth of the economy, gold became relatively\nmore valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) would drop,\ncausing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over\na century when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as\nmoney in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nModern-day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no\nlonger tied to the value of gold. The amount of money in the\neconomy is influenced by monetary policy, which is the process by\nwhich a central bank influences the economy to achieve specific\ngoals. Often, the goal of monetary policy is to maintain low and\nstable inflation, directly via an inflation targeting strategy,\n[51] \nor\nindirectly via a fixed exchange rate system against a major currency\nwith a stable inflation rate.\n[52] \nIn some cases, the central bank may pursue various supplementary goals. For\nexample, it is clearly stated in the Federal Reserve Act that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open\nMarket Committee should seek \"to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices,\nand moderate long-term interest rates.\"\n[53]\nA failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that\ndepends on it. These include hyperinflation, stagflation, recession, high unemployment, shortages of\nimported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less\nefficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nMonetary policy strategies have changed over time.\n[54] \nSome of the tools used to conduct contemporary\nmonetary policy include:\n[55]\nchanging the interest rate at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from)\nthe commercial banks\nMonetary policy\n\nPresident J. K. Paasikivi illustrated in a\nformer Finnish 10 mark banknote from\n1980\nopen market operations including currency purchases or sales\nforward guidance, i.e. publishing forecasts to communicate the likely future course of\nmonetary policy\nraising or lowering bank reserve requirements\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve is responsible for conducting monetary policy, while in the eurozone the\nrespective institution is the European Central Bank. Other central banks with a significant impact on global\nfinances are the Bank of Japan, People's Bank of China and the Bank of England.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s monetary policy in several countries was influenced by an economic theory\nknown as monetarism. Monetarism argued that management of the money supply should be the primary\nmeans of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key\nfinding of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz\n[56] \nsupported by the work of David Laidler,\n[57] \nand many\nothers. It turned out, however, that maintaining a monetary policy strategy of targeting the money supply\ndid not work very well: The relation between money growth and inflation was not as tight as expected by\nmonetarist theory, and the short-run relation between the money supply and the interest rate, which is the\nchief instrument through which the cental bank can influence output and inflation, was unreliable. Both\nproblems were due to unpredictable shifts in the demand for money. Consequently, starting in the early\n1990s a fundamental reorientation took place in most major central banks, starting to target inflation directly\ninstead of the money supply and using the interest rate as their main instrument.\n[58]\nThe definition of money says it is money only \"in a particular\ncountry or socio-economic context\". In general, communities\nonly use a single measure of value, which can be identified in\nthe prices of goods listed for sale. There might be multiple media\nof exchange, which can be observed by what is given to\npurchase goods (\"medium of exchange\"), etc. In most countries,\nthe government acts to encourage a particular forms of money,\nsuch as requiring it for taxes and punishing fraud.\nSome places do maintain two or more currencies, particularly in\nborder towns or high-travel areas. Shops in these locations might\nlist prices and accept payment in multiple currencies. Otherwise, foreign currency is treated as a financial\nasset in the local market. Foreign currency is commonly bought or sold on foreign exchange markets by\ntravelers and traders.\nCommunities can change the money they use, which is known as currency substitution. This can happen\nintentionally, when a government issues a new currency. For example, when Brazil moved from the\nBrazilian cruzeiro to the Brazilian real. It can also happen spontaneously, when the people refuse to accept a\ncurrency experiencing hyperinflation (even if its use is encouraged by the government).\nThe money used by a community can change on a smaller scale. This can come through innovation, such as\nthe adoption of cheques (checks). Gresham's law says that \"bad money drives out good\". That is, when\nbuying a good, a person is more likely to pass on less-desirable items that qualify as \"money\" and hold on\nLocality\n\nto more valuable ones. For example, coins with less silver in them (but which are still valid coins) are more\nlikely to circulate in the community. This may effectively change the money used by a community.\nThe money used by a community does not have to be a currency issued by a government. A famous\nexample of community adopting a new form of money is prisoners-of-war using cigarettes to trade.\n[59]\nCounterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government.\nProducing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as\nmoney itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of Lydian coins which are thought to be\namong the first western coins.\n[60] \nHistorically, objects that were difficult to counterfeit (e.g. shells, rare\nstones, precious metals) were often chosen as money.\n[61] \nBefore the introduction of paper money, the most\nprevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of\ncounterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest\ncounterfeit banknotes are called Superdollars because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S.\ndollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of Euro banknotes and coins since the launch of the\ncurrency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.\n[62]\nMoney laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate\nmoney or other assets. However, in several legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has\nbecome conflated with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse\nof the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional\ncurrency), including terrorism financing, tax evasion, and evading of international sanctions.\nMoney portal\nCalculation in kind\nCoin of account\nCommons-based peer production\nCounterfeit money\nDigital currency\nFinance\nForeign exchange market\nFree Money Day\nGift economy\nIntelligent banknote neutralisation system\nLabour voucher\nLeprosy colony money\nLocal exchange trading system\nMonetary economics\nMoney bag\nMoney management\nNon-monetary economy\nSeigniorage\nSlang terms for money\nSocial capital\nFinancial crimes\nCounterfeiting\nMoney laundering\nSee also\n\nUniversal basic income\nVelocity of Money\nWorld currency\n1.

Albert Apponyi standing\nin the middle.\nNegotiation\nNegotiation is a dialogue between two or more parties to resolve\npoints of difference, gain an advantage for an individual or\ncollective, or craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. The parties\naspire to agree on matters of mutual interest.\n[1] \nThe agreement can\nbe beneficial for all or some of the parties involved. The negotiators\nshould establish their own needs and wants while also seeking to\nunderstand the wants and needs of others involved to increase their\nchances of closing deals, avoiding conflicts, forming relationships\nwith other parties, or maximizing mutual gains.\n[1] \nDistributive\nnegotiations, or compromises, are conducted by putting forward a\nposition and making concessions to achieve an agreement. The\ndegree to which the negotiating parties trust each other to\nimplement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining\nthe success of a negotiation.\nPeople negotiate daily, often without considering it a\nnegotiation.\n[2][3] \nNegotiations may occur in organizations,\nincluding businesses, non-profits, and governments, as well as in\nsales and legal proceedings, and personal situations such as\nmarriage, divorce, parenting, friendship, etc. Professional\nnegotiators are often specialized. Examples of professional\nnegotiators include union negotiators, leverage buyout negotiators,\npeace negotiators, and hostage negotiators. They may also work\nunder other titles, such as diplomats, legislators, or arbitrators.\nNegotiations may also be conducted by algorithms or machines in\nwhat is known as automated\n negotiation.\n[4][1][5] \nIn automated\nnegotiation, the participants and process have to be modeled\ncorrectly.\n[6] \nRecent negotiation embraces complexity.\n[7]\nNegotiation can take a variety of forms in different contexts. These may include conferences between\nmembers of the United Nations to establish international norms, meetings between combatants to end a\nmilitary conflict, meetings between representatives of businesses to bring about a transaction, and\nconversations between parents about how to manage childcare.\n[8] \nMediation is a form of negotiation where\na third party helps the conflicting parties negotiate, usually when they are unable to do so by themselves.\nMediated negotiation can be contrasted with the arbitration, where conflicting parties commit to accepting\nthe decision of a third party. Negotiations in the workplace can impact the entire organization\nperformance.\n[9]\nTypes\n\nJ. K. Paasikivi, Finnish Counselor of\nState and the future President of\nFinland, arriving from negotiations in\nMoscow on October 16, 1939. From\nleft to right: Aarno Yrjö-Koskinen,\nPaasikivi, Johan Nykopp and Aladár\nPaasonen.\nNegotiation theorists generally distinguish between two primary\ntypes of negotiation: distributive negotiation and integrative\nnegotiation.\n[10] \nThe type of negotiation that takes place is\ndependent on the mindset of the negotiators and the situation of the\nnegotiation. For example, one-off encounters where lasting\nrelationships do not occur are more likely to produce distributive\nnegotiations whereas lasting relationships are more likely to require\nintegrative negotiating.\n[11] \nTheorists vary in their labeling and\ndefinition of these two fundamental types.\nDistributive negotiation, compromise, positional negotiation, or\nhard-bargaining negotiation attempts to distribute a \"fixed pie\" of\nbenefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero-sum\nconditions, where it is assumed that any gain made by one party\nwill be at the expense of the other. Haggling over prices on an open market, as in the purchase of a car or\nhome, is an example of distributive negotiation.\nIn a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme or fixed position that they know will not be\naccepted, and then seeks to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive\nof negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves\npeople who have never had a previous interactive relationship with each other and are unlikely to do so\nagain shortly, although all negotiations usually have some distributive element.\n[12] \nSince prospect theory\nindicates that people tend to prioritize the minimization of losses over the maximization of gains, this form\nof negotiation is likely to be more acrimonious and less productive in agreement.\n[13]\nIntegrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, win-win or principled negotiation. It is a set\nof techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking\nadvantage of the fact that different parties often value various outcomes differently.\n[14] \nWhile distributive\nnegotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a \"fixed pie\") to be divided between the parties,\nintegrative negotiation attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation (\"expand the pie\") by either\n\"compensating\" the loss of one item with gains from another (\"trade-offs\" or logrolling), or by constructing\nor reframing the issues of the conflict in such a way that both parties benefit (\"win-win\" negotiation).\n[15]\nHowever, even integrative negotiation is likely to have some distributive elements, especially when the\ndifferent parties value some items to the same degree or when details are left to be allocated at the end of the\nnegotiation. While concession by at least one party is always necessary for negotiations,\n[16] \nresearch shows\nthat people who concede more quickly are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial\nsolutions. Therefore, early concession reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation.\n[17]\nIntegrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the formation of a relationship, although\nINSEAD professor Horacio Falcao has stated that, counter-intuitively, trust is a helpful aid to successful\nwin-win negotiation but not a necessary requirement: he argues that promotion of interdependence is a more\neffective strategy that development of trust.\n[18] \nIntegrative negotiation can also involve creative problem-\nDistributive negotiation\nIntegrative negotiation\n\nsolving in the pursuit of mutual gains. It sees a good agreement as one that provides optimal gain for both\nparties, rather than maximum individual gain. Each party seeks to allow the other party sufficient benefit\nthat both will hold to the agreement.\nProductive negotiation focuses on the underlying interests of both parties rather than their starting positions\nand approaches negotiation as a shared problem-solving exercise rather than an individualized battle.\nAdherence to objective and principled criteria is the basis for productive negotiation and agreement.\n[19]\nText-based negotiation refers to the process of working up the text of an agreement that all parties are\nwilling to accept and sign. Negotiating parties may begin with a draft text, consider new textual\nsuggestions, and work to find the middle ground among various differing positions.\n[20]\nCommon examples of text-based negotiation include the redaction of a constitution, law or sentence by a\nconstitutional assembly, legislature or court respectively. Other more specific examples are United Nations'\nnegotiation regarding the reform of the UN Security Council\n[21] \nand the formation of the international\nagreement underpinning the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in the Asia-Pacific\nRegion,\n[22] \nwhere the parties involved failed in 2019 to agree on a text which would suit India.\n[23]\nSuch negotiations are often founded on the principle that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". For\nexample, this principle, also known as the single undertaking approach, is often used in World Trade\nOrganization negotiations,\n[24] \nalthough some negotiations relax this requirement.\n[25] \nThe principle formed\npart of the British negotiating approach for the Brexit deal following the UK's withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union.\n[26]\nIntegrated negotiation is a strategic attempt to maximize value in any single negotiation through the astute\nlinking and sequencing of other negotiations and decisions related to one's operating activities.\nThis approach in complex settings is executed by mapping out all potentially relevant negotiations,\nconflicts, and operating decisions to integrate helpful connections among them while minimizing any\npotentially harmful connections (see examples below).\nIntegrated negotiation is not to be confused with integrative negotiation, a different concept (as outlined\nabove) related to a non-zero-sum approach to creating value in negotiations.\nIntegrated negotiation was first identified and labeled by the international negotiator and author Peter\nJohnston in his book Negotiating with Giants.\n[27]\nOne of the examples cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first\nmajor oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in\nPittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland, because he recognized that he would have\nto negotiate with the rail companies transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major\nrailroad, which would therefore be able to dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads\nthat Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The\nText-based negotiation\nIntegrated negotiation\n\nleverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to\nCleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who\nfailed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.\n[28]\nOther examples of integrated negotiation include the following:\nIn sports, athletes in the final year of their contracts will ideally hit peak performance so they\ncan negotiate robust, long-term contracts in their favor.\n[29]\nA union needs to negotiate and resolve any significant internal conflicts to maximize its\ncollective clout before going to the table to negotiate a new contract with management.\nIf purchases for similar goods or services are occurring independently of one another across\ndifferent government departments, recognizing this and consolidating orders into one large\nvolume purchase can help create buying leverage and cost savings in negotiations with\nsuppliers.\nA tech start-up looking to negotiate being bought out by a larger industry player in the future\ncan improve its odds of that happening by ensuring, wherever possible, that its systems,\ntechnology, competencies, and culture are as compatible as possible with those of its most\nlikely buyer.\n[30]\nA politician negotiating support for a presidential run may want to avoid bringing on board\nany high-profile supporters who risk alienating other important potential supporters while\navoiding any unexpected new policies that could also limit the size of their growing\ncoalition.\n[31]\nWhen a party pretends to negotiate but secretly has no intention of compromising, the party is negotiating in\nbad faith; for example, when a political party sees political benefit in appearing to negotiate without having\nany intention of making the compromises necessary to settle.\n[32][33]\nBad faith negotiations are often used in political science and political psychology to refer to negotiating\nstrategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise or a model of information processing.\n[34]\nThe \"inherent bad faith model\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first\nput forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles' beliefs and his model of\ninformation processing.\n[35] \nIt is the most widely studied model of one's opponent:\n[36] \nA state is presumed\nimplacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or\nsigns of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union.\n[36]\nThe total of advantages and disadvantages to be distributed in a negotiation is illustrated with the term\nnegotiation pie.\n[37] \nThe course of the negotiation can either lead to an increase, shrinking, or stagnation of\nthese values. If the negotiating parties can expand the total pie, a win-win situation is possible, assuming\nthat both parties profit from the expansion of the pie. In practice, however, this maximization approach is\noftentimes impeded by the so-called small pie bias, i.e. the psychological underestimation of the negotiation\npie's size. Likewise, the possibility to increase the pie may be underestimated due to the so-called\nincompatibility bias.\n[38] \nContrary to enlarging the pie, the pie may also shrink during negotiations e.g. due\nto (excessive) negotiation costs.\n[38]\nBad faith\nNegotiation pie\n\nIn litigation, a negotiation pie is shared when parties settle outside the court. It is possible\n[39] \nto quantify the\nconditions under which parties will agree to settle, and how legal expenses and the absolute coefficient of\nrisk aversion affect the size of the pie as well as the decision to settle outside the court.\nDue to different cultural lenses negotiation style differ worldwide.\n[40][41] \nThese differences comprise\namong others how the parties exchange information, the use of different strategies, conceptions of the\nnature of negotiation, the use of power, the use of options. Negotiations as they are often taught and used by\npracticionners in \"Western\" countries may not be effective or may even be counterproductive in \"non-\nWestern\" countries – such as Asian countries.\n[42][43]\nThere are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.\nOne view of negotiation involves three basic elements: process, behavior, and substance. The process refers\nto how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations, the tactics used\nby the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the\nrelationships among these parties, the communication between them, and the styles they adopt. The\nsubstance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and – more helpfully –\ninterests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.\n[44]\nAnother view of negotiation comprises four elements: strategy, process, tools, and tactics. The Strategy\ncomprises top-level goals. Which typically include the relationship and the outcome. Processes and tools\ninclude the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics\ninclude more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to\nthis persuasion and influence, asserting that these have become integral to modern-day negotiation success,\nand so should not be omitted.\n[44]\nStrategic approaches to concession-making include consideration of the optimum time to make a\nconcession, making concessions in installments, not all at once, and ensuring that the opponent is aware that\na concession has been made, rather than a re-expression of a position already outlined, and aware of the\ncost incurred in making the concession, especially where the other party is generally less aware of the\nnature of the business or the product being negotiated.\n[45]\nNegotiators do not need to sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties.\nRather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own\nand use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. Understanding perspectives can help move parties\ntoward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al. illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve\nperspective-taking in the book Getting to Yes, and through the following, negotiators can separate people\nfrom the problem itself:\nInternational negotiation\nStrategies\nStages in the negotiation process\n\nPut yourself in their shoes – People tend to search for information that confirms their own\nbeliefs and often ignore information that contradicts prior beliefs. To negotiate effectively, it is\nimportant to empathize with the other party's point of view. One should be open to other\nviews and attempt to approach an issue from the perspective of the other.\nDiscuss each other's perceptions – A more direct approach to understanding the other\nparty is to explicitly discuss each other's perceptions. Each individual should openly and\nhonestly share their perceptions without assigning blame or judgment to the other.\nFind opportunities to act inconsistently with their views – The other party may have prior\nperceptions and expectations about the other side. The other side can act in a way that\ndirectly contradicts those preconceptions, effectively conveying that the party is interested in\nan integrative negotiation.\nFace-saving – This approach justifies a stance based on one's previously expressed\nprinciples and values in a negotiation. This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, it\nis more understandable from the opposing party's perspective.\n[46]\nAdditionally, negotiators can use specific communication techniques to build stronger relationships and\ndevelop more meaningful negotiation solutions.\nActive listening – Listening is more than just hearing what the other side says. Active\nlistening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It\ninvolves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person\nexactly what they mean, they may realize the negotiator takes them seriously and is not\nsimply walking through a routine. The Australian Mosaic Project Services business\ncommends \"proactive\" rather than just \"active\" listening, in which more emphasis is placed\non the asking of questions as well as listening actively to the answers given.\n[47]\nSpeak for a purpose – Too much information can be as harmful as too little. Before\ndiscussing an important point, determine exactly what to communicate to the other party.\nDetermine the exact purpose that this shared information will serve.\n[46]\nA skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to\nobtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process, the negotiator attempts to\ndetermine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their\ndemands accordingly. A \"successful\" negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator can\nobtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently\nbreak off negotiations.\nSkilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis to a straightforward\npresentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as cherry picking.\nIntimidation and salami tactics may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations.\n[48]\nAnother negotiation tactic is the bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad\nguy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and\nunderstanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while soliciting concessions and\nagreement from the opponent.\n[49]\nEmploying an advocate\nBATNA\n\nThe best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA, is the most advantageous alternative course of\naction a negotiator can take should the current negotiation end without reaching an agreement. The quality\nof a BATNA has the potential to improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can\nempower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward.\n[50] \nAlternatives\nneed to be actual and actionable to be of value. Negotiators may also consider the other party's BATNA and\nhow it compares to what they are offering during the negotiation.\n[51]\nKenneth W. Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation.\n[52][53] \nThese five strategies have\nbeen frequently described in the literature and are based on the dual-concern model.\n[54] \nThe dual-concern\nmodel of conflict resolution is a perspective that assumes individuals' preferred method of dealing with\nconflict is based on two themes or dimensions:\n[55]\n1. A concern for self (i.e., assertiveness), and\n2. A concern for others (i.e., empathy).\nBased on this model, individuals balance their concern for personal needs and interests with the needs and\ninterests of others. The following five styles can be used based on individuals' preferences, depending on\ntheir pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong\ndispositions toward numerous styles.\nAccommodating\nIndividuals who enjoy solving the other party's problems and preserving personal\nrelationships. Accommodators are sensitive to the emotional states, body language, and\nverbal signals of the other parties. They can, however, feel taken advantage of in situations\nwhen the other party places little emphasis on the relationship. Accommodation is a\npassive but prosocial approach to conflict. People solve both large and small conflicts by\ngiving in to the demands of others. Sometimes, they yield because they realize that their\nposition is in error, so they agree with the viewpoint adopted by others. In other cases,\nhowever, they may withdraw their demands without really being convinced that the other\nside is correct, but for the sake of group unity or in the interest of time—they withdraw all\ncomplaints. Thus, yielding can reflect either genuine conversion or superficial compliance.\nAvoiding\nIndividuals who do not like to negotiate and do not do it unless warranted. When\nnegotiating, avoiders tend to defer and dodge the confrontational aspects of negotiating;\nhowever, they may be perceived as tactful and diplomatic. Inaction is a passive means of\ndealing with disputes. Those who avoid conflicts adopt a \"wait and see\" attitude, hoping\nthat problems will solve themselves. Avoiders often tolerate conflicts, allowing them to\nsimmer without doing anything to minimize them. Rather than openly discussing\ndisagreements, people who rely on avoidance change the subject, skip meetings, or even\nleave the group altogether (Bayazit & Mannix, 2003). Sometimes they simply agree to\ndisagree (a modus vivendi).\nCollaborating\nIndividuals who enjoy negotiations that involve solving tough problems in creative ways.\nCollaborators are good at using negotiations to understand the concerns and interests of\nthe other parties. Collaborating is an active, pro-social, and pro-self approach to conflict\nresolution. Collaborating people identify the issues underlying the dispute and then work\ntogether to identify a solution that is satisfying to both sides. This orientation, which is also\ndescribed as collaboration, problem solving, or a win-win orientation entreats both sides in\nthe dispute to consider their opponent's outcomes as well as their own\n[56]\nConflict styles\n\nCompeting\nIndividuals who enjoy negotiations because they present an opportunity to win something.\nCompetitive negotiators have strong instincts for all aspects of negotiating and are often\nstrategic. Because their style can dominate the bargaining process, competitive\nnegotiators often neglect the importance of relationships. Competing is an active, pro-self\nmeans of dealing with conflict that involves forcing others to accept one's view. Those who\nuse this strategy tend to see conflict as a win-lose situation and so use competitive,\npowerful tactics to intimidate others. Fighting (forcing, dominating, or contending) can take\nmany forms, including authoritative mandate, challenges, arguing, insults, accusations,\ncomplaining, vengeance, and even physical violence (Morrill, 1995). These conflict\nresolution methods are all contentious ones because they involve imposing one's solution\non the other party.\nCompromising\nIndividuals who are eager to close the deal by doing what is fair and equal for all parties\ninvolved in the negotiation. Compromisers can be useful when there is limited time to\ncomplete the deal; however, compromisers often unnecessarily rush the negotiation\nprocess and make concessions too quickly.\nThree basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation\nProject. These types of negotiators are soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.\nSoft\nThese people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a gentle style of\nbargaining. The offers they make are not in their best interests, they yield to others'\ndemands, avoid confrontation, and they maintain good relations with fellow negotiators.\nTheir perception of others is one of friendship, and their goal is agreement. They do not\nseparate the people from the problem but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills and\ninsist on the agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and changing their\nopinions.\nHard\nThese people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such as \"this is my\nfinal offer\" and \"take it or leave it\". They make threats, are distrustful of others, insist on\ntheir position, and apply pressure to negotiate. They see others as adversaries and their\nultimate goal is victory. Additionally, they search for one single answer and insist you agree\nwith it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft bargainers), but they\nare hard on both the people involved and the problem.\nPrincipled\nIndividuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions and do so by sidestepping\ncommitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions,\nmotives, and needs of the people involved. They separate the people from the problem,\nexplore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of\npersonal will. They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power, pressure,\nself-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral\nstandards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.\nResearchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore several tactics to\nreach the best solution for their problems, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an\nindividual using soft or hard-bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).\nTypes of negotiators\nTactics\n\nTactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult\nto identify, and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and\nwhen the focus is on taking as much value off the table as possible.\n[57] \nMany negotiation tactics exist.\nBelow are a few commonly used tactics.\nAuction:\n The bidding process is designed to create competition.\n[58] \nWhen multiple parties\nwant the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out\non something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on,\nbut they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can\ndrive up the price.\nBrinkmanship: One party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other\nnegotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of \"hard nut\"\napproach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the \"brink\" or edge of\nwhat that party is willing to accommodate. Successful brinkmanship convinces the other\nparty they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the\nproposed agreement.\n[59]\nBogey: Negotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is\nvery important.\n[60] \nThen, later in the negotiation, the issue can be traded for a major\nconcession of actual importance.\nCalling a higher authority: To mitigate too far-reaching concessions, deescalate, or\novercome a deadlock situation, one party makes the further negotiation process dependent\non the decision of a decision maker, not present at the negotiation table.\n[61]\nChicken: Negotiators propose extreme measures often in the form of bluffs to force the other\nparty to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous when\nparties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.\nConcession: One party offers up something with hope reaching or coming closer to an\nagreement.\n[62]\nDefense in Depth: Several layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further\nconcessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority.\n[63] \nIn other\nwords, each time the offer goes to a decision-maker, that decision maker asks to add another\nconcession to close the deal.\nDeadlines: Give the other party a deadline, forcing them to make a decision. This method\nuses time to apply pressure on the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.\nFlinch: Flinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal. Common\nexamples of flinching are gasping for air or a visible expression of surprise or shock. The\nflinch can be done consciously or unconsciously.\n[64] \nThe flinch signals to the opposite party\nthat you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their\naspirations.\n[65] \nSeeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying,\n\"I'm shocked\".\nGood Guy/Bad Guy: Within the tactic of good guy/bad guy (synonyms are good cop/bad\ncop or black hat/white hat) oftentimes positive and unpleasant tasks are divided between two\nnegotiators on the same negotiation side or unpleasant tasks or decisions are allocated to a\n(real or fictitious) outsider. The good guy supports the conclusion of the contract and\nemphasizes positive aspects of the negotiation (mutual interests). The bad guy criticizes\nnegative aspects (opposing interests). The division of the two roles allows for more\nconsistent behavior and credibility of the individual negotiators. As the good guy promotes\nthe contract, he/she can build trust with the other side.\n[66]\nHolding out for concession: Negotiators can choose avoiding giving concessions and\nhold out in the hope that the other side will concede before they do. This tough bargaining\nposition can maximize the negotiators ex-post (actual) outcome.\n[16]\n\nHighball/Low-ball or Ambit claim: Depending on whether selling or buying, sellers or\nbuyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable. The\ntheory is that the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their opening offer and move\nclose to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement).\n[67]\nAnother advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when\nthey make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the\nopposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.\nThe Nibble: Also known under the salami tactic or quivering quill, nibbling is the demand for\nproportionally small concessions that have not been discussed previously just before closing\nthe deal.\n[60] \nThis method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by adding \"just\none more thing\".\nSnow Job: Negotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have\ndifficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion.\n[68] \nNegotiators\nmay also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by\na non-expert.\nMirroring: When people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more\npositive. To create trust and rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's\nbehavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of\nwhat another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the\nsubject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement.\n[69] \nMirroring\ncan help create trust and establish a relationship.\nAnchoring: Anchoring is the process of establishing a reference point first to guide the other\nperson closer to your suggested price. It is often presented at the beginning of a negotiation\nto influence the rest of the negotiation. As an example, say you want to sell a car for 50,000\ndollars. Now a customer walks in saying they want to buy a car. You say that you can sell the\ncar for 65,000 dollars. Their counteroffer would probably be 50,000–55,000 dollars. This also\nworks and vice versa for buying something. The idea here is that we are narrowing the other\nparties' expectations down or up.\n[70] \nTo counter-anchoring, you should point out the fact that\nthey are anchoring and say that they need to drive it down to an acceptable price.\nCommunication is a key element of negotiation. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively\nconvey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally\nbut non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication\nworks, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally\nwhile keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.\n[71]\nIn a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By anchoring one's\nposition, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. Similarly, one can \"anchor\" and\ngain an advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.\nPersonal space: The person at the head of the table is the apparent symbol of power.\nNegotiators can negate this strategic advantage by positioning allies in the room to surround\nthat individual.\nNonverbal communication\nExamples\nNon-verbal \"anchoring\"\n\nFirst impression: Begin the negotiation with positive gestures and enthusiasm. Look the\nperson in the eye with sincerity. If you cannot maintain eye contact, the other person might\nthink you are hiding something or that you are insincere. Give a solid handshake.\n[72]\nBeing able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the\ncommunication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person's verbal and non-verbal\ncommunication and reconciling them, negotiators can come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity\nin body language include:\nNervous Laugh: A laugh not matching the situation. This could be a sign of nervousness or\ndiscomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the\nperson's true feelings.\nPositive words but negative body language: If someone asks their negotiation partner if they\nare annoyed and the person pounds their fist and responds sharply, \"what makes you think\nanything is bothering me?\"\n[73]\nHands raised in a clenched position: The person raising his/her hands in this position\nreveals frustration even when he/she is smiling. This is a signal that the person doing it may\nbe holding back a negative attitude.\n[74]\nIf possible, it may be helpful for negotiation partners to spend time together in a comfortable\nsetting outside of the negotiation room. Knowing how each partner non-verbally\ncommunicates outside of the negotiation setting helps negotiation partners sense the\nincongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication.\nThe way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each\nis to the other person's message and ideas.\nFace and eyes: Receptive negotiators smile, and make plenty of eye contact. This conveys\nthe idea that there is more interest in the person than in what is being said. On the other\nhand, non-receptive negotiators make little to no eye contact. Their eyes may be squinted,\njaw muscles clenched and head turned slightly away from the speaker\nArms and hands: To show receptivity, negotiators should spread their arms and open a\nhands-on table or relax on their lap. Negotiators show poor receptivity when their hands are\nclenched, crossed, positioned in front of their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.\nLegs and Feet: Receptive negotiators sit with legs together or one leg slightly in front of the\nother. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place their hands on their hips with\ntheir body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with their legs crossed,\npointing away from the speaker.\nTorso: Receptive negotiators sit on the edge of their chairs, unbuttoning their suit coats with\ntheir bodies tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators may lean back in their\nchairs and keep their suit coats buttoned.\nReceptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed.\n[75]\nDie-hard bargainers\nLack of trust\nReading non-verbal communication\nConveying receptivity\nBarriers\n\nInformational vacuums and negotiator's dilemma\nStructural impediments\nSpoilers\nCultural and gender differences\nCommunication problems\nThe power of dialogue\n[76]\nEmotions play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their\neffect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation.\nDuring negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative\nemotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations\nto break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often\nfacilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining\nconcessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and\nrelational outcomes\n[77] \nand may play out differently across cultural boundaries.\n[78]\nDispositions for effects affect various stages of negotiation: which strategies to use, which strategies are\nchosen,\n[79] \nthe way the other party and their intentions are perceived,\n[80] \ntheir willingness to reach an\nagreement, and the final negotiated outcomes.\n[81] \nPositive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) of\none or more of the negotiating sides can lead to very different outcomes.\nEven before the negotiation process starts, people in a positive mood have more confidence,\n[82] \nand higher\ntendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy.\n[79] \nDuring the negotiation, negotiators who are in a positive\nmood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics,\n[83] \nand\nmore cooperative strategies.\n[79] \nThis, in turn, increases the likelihood that parties will reach their\ninstrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains.\n[84] \nIndeed, compared with negotiators\nwith negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and\ntended to honor those agreements more.\n[79] \nThose favorable outcomes are due to better decision-making\nprocesses, such as flexible thinking, creative problem-solving, respect for others' perspectives, willingness\nto take risks, and higher confidence.\n[85] \nThe post-negotiation positive effect has beneficial consequences as\nwell. It increases satisfaction with the achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future\ninteractions.\n[85] \nThe PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings\ncommitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions.\n[85]\nPA also has its drawbacks: it distorts the perception of self-performance, such that performance is judged to\nbe relatively better than it is.\n[82] \nThus, studies involving self-reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.\nEmotion\nAffect effect\nPositive affect\nNegative affect\n\nNegative affect has detrimental effects on various stages in the negotiation process. Although various\nnegative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is anger. Angry negotiators plan\nto use more competitive strategies and cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts.\n[79] \nThese\ncompetitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes. During negotiations, anger disrupts the process\nby reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention, and\nchanging their central goal from reaching an agreement to retaliating against the other side.\n[83] \nAngry\nnegotiators pay less attention to the opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus\nachieving lower joint gains.\n[86] \nMoreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their\npreferences, it increases the likelihood that they will reject profitable offers.\n[83] \nOpponents who get angry\n(or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors.\n[49] \nAnger does not help achieve\nnegotiation goals either: it reduces joint gains\n[79] \nand does not boost personal gains, as angry negotiators do\nnot succeed.\n[86] \nMoreover, negative emotions lead to acceptance of settlements that are not in a positive\nutility function but rather have a negative utility.\n[87] \nHowever, the expression of negative emotions during\nnegotiation can sometimes be beneficial: legitimately expressed anger can be an effective way to show one's\ncommitment, sincerity, and needs.\n[83] \nMoreover, although NA reduces gains in integrative tasks, it is a\nbetter strategy than PA in distributive tasks (such as zero-sum).\n[85] \nIn his work on negative affect arousal\nand white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through\nobservations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins. Negotiation may be negatively\naffected, in turn, by submerged hostility toward an ethnic or gender group.\n[88]\nResearch indicates that a negotiator's emotions do not necessarily affect the negotiation process. Albarracın\net al. (2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence\nof environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:\n1. Identification of the effect: requires high motivation, high ability, or both.\n2. The determination that the effect is relevant and important for the judgment: requires that\neither the motivation, the ability, or both are low.\nAccording to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When\nboth ability and motivation are low, the effect is identified, and when both are high the effect is identified\nbut discounted as irrelevant to judgment.\n[89] \nA possible implication of this model is, for example, that the\npositive effects of PA have on negotiations (as described above) are seen only when either motivation or\nability is low.\nMost studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own emotions on the process.\nHowever, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect\nprocesses both at the group and the personal levels. When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is\na necessary condition for its emotion to effect,\n[80] \nand visibility enhances the effect.\n[84] \nEmotions contribute\nto negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from\nengaging in destructive behaviors and indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the\nsame way, while NA points out that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.\n[85]\nPartner's emotions can have two basic effects on the negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal\nor complementary.\n[81] \nFor example, disappointment or sadness might lead to compassion and more\nConditions for emotion affect\nEffect of partner's emotions\n\ncooperation.\n[85] \nIn a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people\nreacted to the partner's emotions in a reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were\nfound to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and are strategies chosen:\nAnger caused the opponents to place lower demands and to concede more in a zero-sum\nnegotiation, but also to evaluate the negotiation less favorably.\n[90] \nIt provoked both\ndominating and yielding behaviors of the opponent.\n[81]\nPride \nled to more integrative and compromise strategies by the partner.\n[81]\nGuilt or regret expressed by the negotiator led to a better impression of him by the opponent,\nhowever, it also led the opponent to place higher demands.\n[80] \nOn the other hand, personal\nguilt was related to more satisfaction with what one achieved.\n[85]\nWorry or disappointment left a bad impression on the opponent but led to relatively lower\ndemands by the opponent.\n[80]\nMake emotions explicit and validate – Taking a more proactive approach in discussing\none's emotions can allow for a negotiation to focus on the problem itself, rather than any\nunexpressed feelings. It is important to allow both parties to share their emotions.\nAllow time to let off steam – It is possible that one party may feel angry or frustrated at\nsome point during the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow\nthe individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback on the\nsubstance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances\nare released, it may become easier to negotiate.\nSymbolic gestures – Consider that an apology, or any other simple act, may be one of the\nmost effective and low-cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.\n[46]\nEmpathy – In every negotiation, emotions will play a major role in determining what is said.\nIt is possible to overreact and misinterpret what the other party says by projecting\nassumptions. To avoid miscommunication and build a collaborative environment, it is\nimportant to shift the focus to the other party and be fully present with them, listening without\njudgment instead of acting in self-interest and focusing on one's own needs and fears. To\nincrease one's chances of reaching a deal that works for both parties, one needs to be\nfocused on the other party, their emotions, their interests, and their worries in order to give\nthem what they want. When the other party feels heard and acknowledged, barriers to\ncommunication fall, and reaching a consensus is much more likely to happen.\nNegotiation is a complex interaction. Capturing all its complexity is a very difficult task, let alone isolating\nand controlling only certain aspects of it. For this reason, most negotiation studies are done under laboratory\nconditions and focus only on some aspects. Although such studies have their advantages, they do have\nmajor drawbacks when studying emotions:\nEmotions in laboratory studies are usually manipulated and are therefore relatively 'cold' (not\nintense). Although those 'cold' emotions might be enough to show effects, they are\nqualitatively different from the 'hot' emotions often experienced during negotiations.\n[91]\nIn real life, people select which negotiations to enter, which affects emotional commitment,\nmotivation, and interests, but this is not the case in lab studies.\n[85]\nDealing with emotions\nProblems with laboratory studies\n\nStudents from the University of Tromsø\nand the University of Toronto during the\n5th International Negotiation Tournament –\nWarsaw Negotiation Round in the Polish\nSenate (2014)\nLaboratory studies tend to focus on relatively few well-defined emotions. Real-life scenarios\nprovoke a much wider scale of emotions.\n[85]\nCoding the emotions has a double catch: if done by a third side, some emotions might not be\ndetected as the negotiator sublimates them for strategic reasons. Self-report measures might\novercome this, but they are usually filled only before or after the process, and if filled during\nthe process might interfere with it.\n[85]\nWhile negotiations involving more than two parties are less often researched, some results from two-party\nnegotiations still apply to more than two parties. One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see\nlanguage similarity arise between the two negotiating parties. In three-party negotiations, language similarity\nstill arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation\nadopted language similarities from the other parties.\n[92]\nDue to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation\nin the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can\neffectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation.\nThere is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than\nin a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific\nroles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team\nreduces the number of blunders and increases familiarity in a\nnegotiation.\n[93]\nHowever, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full\ncapacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in\nthe effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs\nthrough solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when\none team member reduces his or her utility (benefit) to increase\nthe benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to\noccur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent do not align with\nevery team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained\namong the team.\n[94]\nIntuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a\ncooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when\nintegration is possible. The integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different\nimportance to each team member. The integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of\neach member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.\nThus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences before the\nnegotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team's joint priorities, which they\ncan take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more\nGroup composition\nMulti-party\nTeam\n\nlikely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and\nincorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which\nlargely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is\nan effective tool for fostering knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which\nnegotiation issues were of the highest importance.\n[95]\nWomen often excel in collaborative and integrative negotiations, where they can leverage their strong\ncommunication skills and empathy to find mutually beneficial solutions. However, they may face challenges\nin competitive or distributive negotiations, where a more assertive and confrontational approach is typically\nrequired. Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social\nbacklash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-\nadvocating men, and other advocating men. Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in\naddition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants.\n[96] \nThe backlash associated with this\ntype of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the\nalternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine.\n[97] \nMales, however, do not appear to face\nany type of backlash for not being self-advocating.\n[98]\nThis research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates\nparticipating in a negotiation regarding compensation. This study showed that women who initiated\nnegotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations. In another variation of this\nparticular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation\npackage or initiating negotiations. Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while\nwomen evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations. In this particular\nexperiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was\nno variation with the negotiation initiated with another female.\n[99]\nResearch also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the\ngender of the opposite party. In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation in the level of\ntrust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups, there was an increase in deceptive tactics\nwhen it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy. In all-female groups,\nthere were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.\n[97]\nThe academic world contains a unique management system, wherein faculty members, some of whom have\ntenure, reside in academic units (e.g. departments), and are overseen by chairs, or heads. These chairs/heads\nare in turn supervised by deans of the college where their academic unit resides. Negotiation is an area\nwhere faculties, chairs/heads, and their deans have little preparation; their doctoral degrees are typically in a\nhighly specialized area according to their academic expertise. However, the academic environment\nfrequently presents situations where negotiation takes place. For example, many faculties are hired with the\nexpectation that they will conduct research and publish scholarly works. For these faculties, where their\nresearch requires equipment, space, and/or funding, negotiation of a \"start-up\" package is critical for their\nsuccess and future promotion.\n[100][101] \nAlso, department chairs often find themselves in situations, typically\ninvolving resource redistribution where they must negotiate with their dean, on behalf of their unit. And\nWomen\nAcademic negotiation\n\ndeans oversee colleges where they must optimize limited resources, such as research space or operating\nfunds while at the same time creating an environment that fosters student success, research\naccomplishments, and more.\n[100][101][102]\nIntegrative negotiation is the type predominately found in academic negotiation – where trust and long-term\nrelationships between personnel are valued. Techniques found to be particularly useful in academic settings\ninclude:\n[100][101]\n1. doing your homework – grounding your request in facts\n2. knowing your value\n3. listening actively and acknowledging what is being said\n4. putting yourself in their shoes\n5. asking – negotiation begins with an ask\n6. not committing immediately\n7. managing emotion\nkeeping in mind the principle of a \"wise agreement\",\n[103] \nwith its associated emphasis on\nmeeting the interests of both parties to the extent possible as a key working point.\nThe word \"negotiation\" originated in the early 15th century from the Old French negociacion from Latin\nnegotiatio from neg- \"no\" and otium \"leisure\".\n[104] \nThese terms mean \"business, trade, traffic\". By the late\n1570s negotiation had the definition, \"to communicate in search of mutual agreement\". With this new\nintroduction and this meaning, it showed a shift from \"doing business\" to \"bargaining about\" business.\n[104]\nAlternating offers protocol\nAppeasement\nCollaborative software\nCollective action\nConciliation\nConsistency (negotiation)\nContract\nCross-cultural\nCross-cultural differences in decision-\nmaking\nDelaying tactic\nDeterrence\nDiplomacy\nDispute resolution\nExpert determination\nFlipism\nGame theory\nImpasse\nInternational relations\nLeadership\nMultilateralism\nNash equilibrium\nPrincipled negotiation\nPrisoner's dilemma\nProgram on Negotiation\nTrust metric\n1.

According to the APA\nDictionary of Psychology, potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to\nprovide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, identity, meaningful roles, and a\nsense of belonging.\n[1]\nMany different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs,\nproponents, and in some cases leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step\nculture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become integrated into\nmainstream language.\n[3]: 188\nSelf-help groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and caregivers. As well as\nfeaturing long-time members sharing experiences, these health groups can become support groups and\nclearinghouses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying health\nproblems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer or\nmutual-support groups.\nIn classical antiquity, Hesiod's Works and Days \"opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every\nway that Hesiod can think of.\"\n[4]: 94\nThe Stoics offered ethical advice \"on the notion of eudaimonia—of well-being, welfare,\nflourishing.\"\n[4]: 371 \nThe \nDiscourses \nof Epictetus can be read as a sort of early self-help advice column, and\nthe Meditations of Marcus Aurelius as the journal of someone engaged on a deliberate self-help program.\nThe genre of mirror-of-princes writing, which has a long history in Greco-Roman and Western Renaissance\nliterature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom literature. Proverbs from many periods, collected\nand uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.\nHistory\n\nThe hyphenated compound word \"self-help\" often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the\ndoctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their initiative to remedy a wrong.\n[5]\nSome consider the self-help movement to have been inaugurated by George Combe's Constitution (1828),\nfrom the way that it advocated personal responsibility and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-\nimprovement through education or proper self-control.\n[6] \nIn 1841, an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nentitled Compensation, was published suggesting \"every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults\" and\n\"acquire habits of self-help\" as \"our strength grows out of our weakness.\"\n[7] \nSamuel Smiles (1812–1904)\npublished the first explicitly \"self-help\" book, titled Self-Help, in 1859. Its opening sentence: \"Heaven helps\nthose who help themselves\", provides a variation of \"God helps them that help themselves\", the oft-quoted\nmaxim that had also appeared previously in Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanack (1733–1758).\nIn 1902, James Allen published As a Man Thinketh, which proceeds from the conviction that \"a man is\nliterally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.\" Noble thoughts, the book\nmaintains, make for a noble person, while lowly thoughts make for a miserable person. Napoleon Hill's\nThink and Grow Rich (1937) described the use of repeated positive thoughts to attract happiness and wealth\nby tapping into an \"Infinite Intelligence\".\n[8]: 62\nIn 1936, Dale Carnegie further developed the genre with \nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\n.\n[8]: 63\nHaving failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to self-confidence,\nand his books have since sold over 50 million copies.\n[9]\nGroup and corporate attempts to help people help themselves have created a self-help marketplace, with\nLarge Group Awareness Trainings (LGATs)\n[10] \nand psychotherapy systems represented. These offer more-\nor-less prepackaged solutions to instruct people seeking their betterment,\n[11][12] \njust as \"the literature of self-\nimprovement directs the reader to familiar frameworks... what the French fin de siècle social theorist Gabriel\nTarde called 'the grooves of borrowed thought'.\"\n[3]: 160–62\nA subgenre of self-help book series exists, such as the for Dummies guides and The Complete Idiot's Guide\nto..., that are varieties of how-to books.\nAt the start of the 21st century, \"the self-improvement industry, inclusive of books, seminars, audio and\nvideo products, and personal coaching, [was] said to constitute a 2.48-billion dollars-a-year industry\"\n[3]: 11\nin the United States alone. By 2006, research firm Marketdata estimated the \"self-improvement\" market in\nthe U.S. as worth more than US$9 billion—including infomercials, mail-order catalogs, holistic institutes,\nbooks, audio cassettes, motivation-speaker seminars, the personal coaching market, and weight-loss and\nstress-management programs. Market data projected that the total market size would grow to over US$11\nbillion by 2008.\n[13] \nIn 2013 Kathryn Schulz examined \"an $11 billion industry\".\n[14]\nEarly 20th century\nThe market\nStatistics\nSelf-help and professional service delivery\n\nSelf-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—aid by professionals.\n[15]\nConflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that, for\nexample, \"the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism\nor enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather\nlarge conclusions.\"\n[16]\nThe rise of self-help culture led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would\nobject to their classification as \"self-help\" literature, as with \"Deborah Tannen's denial of the self-help role\nof her books\" to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that \"writing a book that becomes a\npopular success...all but ensures that one's work will lose its long-term legitimacy.\"\n[3]: 195 & 245\nPlacebo effects can never be wholly discounted. Careful studies of \"the power of subliminal self-help\ntapes... showed that their content had no real effect... But that's not what the participants thought.\"\n[17]: 264\n\"If they thought they'd listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that\ntheir self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tapes: even though the tapes don't\nwork, people think they do.\"\n[17]: 265\nMuch of the self-help industry may be thought of as part of the \"skin trades. People need haircuts, massage,\ndentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, love and advice.\"\n[18]: 6 \n—a skin trade, \"not a profession\nand a science\".\n[18]: 7 \nIts practitioners thus function as \"part of the personal service industry rather than as\nmental health professionals.\"\n[3]: 229 \nWhile \"there is no proof that twelve-step programs 'are superior to any\nother intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems',\"\n[16]: 178–79 \nat the same\ntime it is clear that \"there is something about 'groupishness' itself which is curative.\"\n[19] \nThus for example\n\"smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0...\nsuggest[ing] an added value to self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous as surrogate\ncommunities.\"\n[20]\nSome psychologists advocate for positive psychology, and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help\nphilosophy. \"[T]he role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main\nstreet—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement.\"\n[21] \nThey aim to refine the\nself-improvement field by intentionally increasing scientifically sound research and well-engineered models.\nThe division of focus and methodologies has produced several sub-fields, in particular: general positive\npsychology, focusing primarily on studying psychological phenomenon and effects; and personal\neffectiveness, focusing primarily on analysis, design, and implementation of qualitative personal growth.\nThe latter of these includes intentionally training new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy\ncommunicator Don Tapscott puts it, \"Why not courses that emphasize designing a great brain?... The design\nindustry is something done to us. I'm proposing we each become designers. But I suppose 'I love the way\nshe thinks' could take on new meaning.\"\n[22]\nBoth self-talk—the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought—and\nsocial support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often via empowering action-promoting\nmessages. Psychologists designed experiments to shed light on how self-talk can result in self-improvement.\nResearch has shown that people prefer second-person pronouns over first-person pronouns when engaging\nin self-talk to achieve goals, regulate their behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.\n[23]\nResearch\n\nSelf-talk also plays an important role in regulating emotions under social stress. People who use non-first-\nperson language tend to exhibit a higher level of visual distance during the process of introspection,\nindicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one's own name may result in enhanced self-\ndistancing.\n[24][25] \nThis form of self-help can enhance people's ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in\nmore challenging and less threatening terms.\n[25]\nScholars have targeted many self-help claims as misleading and incorrect.\n[26][27] \nIn 2005, Steve Salerno\nportrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization\nMovement—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful.\n[2] \n\"Salerno says that\n80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back\nwhether the program worked for them or not.\"\n[26] \nAnother critic pointed out that with self-help books\n\"supply increases the demand… The more people read them, the more they think they need them… more\nlike an addiction than an alliance.\"\n[27]\nSelf-help writers have been described as working \"in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the\nnarrativized… although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature\nof moralizing.\"\n[16]: 173\nChristopher Buckley in his book God Is My Broker asserts: \"The only way to get rich from a self-help book\nis to write one\".\n[28]\nGerald Rosen raised concerns that psychologists were promoting untested self-help books with exaggerated\nclaims rather than conducting studies that could advance the effectiveness of these programs to help the\npublic.\n[29] \nRosen noted the potential benefits of self-help but cautioned that good intentions were not\nsufficient to assure the efficacy and safety of self-administered instructional programs. Rosen and colleagues\nobserved that many psychologists promote untested self-help programs rather than contributing to the\nmeaningful advancement of self-help.\n[30]\nKathryn Schulz suggests that \"the underlying theory of the self-help industry is contradicted by the self-help\nindustry’s existence\".\n[31]\nThe self-help world has become the target of parodies. Walker Percy's odd genre-busting Lost in the\nCosmos\n[32] \nhas been described as \"a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of\nshort stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue\".\n[33]\nAl Franken's self-help guru persona Stuart Smalley was a ridiculous recurring feature on Saturday Night\nLive in the early 1990s.\nCriticism\nIn the media\nParodies and fictional analogies\n\nIn their 2006 book Secrets of The SuperOptimist, authors W.R. Morton and Nathaniel Whitten revealed the\nconcept of \"super optimism\" as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.\nIn his comedy special Complaints and Grievances (2001), George Carlin observes that there is \"no such\nthing\" as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get \"self\" help; and one\nwho accomplishes something without help did not need help to begin with.\n[34]\nIn Margaret Atwood's semi-satiric dystopia Oryx and Crake, university literary studies have declined to the\npoint that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more\nrevealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.\nArete\nConduct book\nDale Carnegie\nIndividualism\nInternal locus of control\nLaw of attraction (New Thought)\nLife hack\nList of twelve-step groups\nLive in the Moment\nLucinda Redick Bassett\nManifestation\nMirror-of-princes writing\nMutual aid society\nMutual self-help housing\nNapoleon Hill\nNeurohacking\nNew Thought Movement\nOutline of self\nPersonal development\nPopular psychology\nPositive psychology\nPreschool education\nSelf Awareness\nSelf-experimentation\nSelf-healing\nSelf-help groups for mental health\nSelf (psychology)\nSelf-sustainability\nSelf-taught\nSophism\nThe Secret (2006 film)\nThink and Grow Rich\nTrue Will\nTwelve-step program\n1.

The central question is\nwhen organisms with conflicting interests, such as in sexual\nselection, should be expected to provide honest signals (no\npresumption being made of conscious intention) rather than\ncheating. Mathematical models describe how signalling can\ncontribute to an evolutionarily stable strategy.\nSignals are given in contexts such as mate selection by females,\nwhich subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure.\nSignals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the\nreceiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying\ninformation which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or\ndishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal,\nwhich might briefly benefit that signaller, at the risk of undermining\nthe signalling system for the whole population.\nThe question of whether the selection of signals works at the level of the individual organism or gene, or at\nthe level of the group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals\nevolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that\ncheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one\ncarrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have\n\"tails\" that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large\nshowy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with\ninconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two\ncopies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could\noccur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and\nbenefits.\nThe same mechanisms can be expected in humans, where researchers have studied behaviours including\nrisk-taking by young men, hunting of large game animals, and costly religious rituals, finding that these\nappear to qualify as costly honest signals.\nWhen animals choose mating partners, traits such as signalling are subject to evolutionary pressure. For\nexample, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses\na mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The\nsignal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various\nhypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation\nSexual selection\n\nEurasian jay, Garrulus glandarius,\ngives honest signals—loud alarm\ncalls—from its tree perch when it\nsees a predator.\nThe yellow-banded poison\ndart frog, Dendrobates\nleucomelas, gives an honest\nsignal of its toxicity to warn\noff predators and reduce the\nfrog's risk of injury.\nhypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal\ninnovation in male senders, in a similar way to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that\nsuccessful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female.\n[1] \nSignallers have\nsometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments,\n[2] \nand receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait\npreferences.\n[3]\nIn biology, signals are traits, including structures and behaviours,\nthat have evolved specifically because they change the behaviour of\nreceivers in ways that benefit the signaller.\n[4] \nTraits or actions that\nbenefit the receiver exclusively are called \"cues\". For example,\nwhen an alert bird deliberately gives a warning call to a stalking\npredator and the predator gives up the hunt, the sound is a \"signal\".\nBut when a foraging bird inadvertently makes a rustling sound in\nthe leaves that attracts predators and increases the risk of predation,\nthe sound is not a signal, but a cue.\n[4]\nSignalling systems are shaped by mutual interests between\nsignallers and receivers. An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay\nwarning off a stalking predator is communicating something useful\nto the predator: that it has been detected by the prey; it might as well\nquit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey, which it is unlikely to catch. When the predator gives up, the\nsignaller can get back to other tasks such as feeding. Once the stalking predator is detected, the signalling\nprey and receiving predator thus have a mutual interest in terminating the hunt.\n[5][6]\nWithin species, mutual interests increase with kinship.\n[7] \nKinship is central to models of signalling between\nrelatives, for instance when broods of nestling birds beg and compete for food from their parents.\n[8][9]\nThe term honesty in animal communication is controversial because in non-\ntechnical usage it implies intent, to discriminate deception from honesty in\nhuman interactions.\n[6] \nHowever, biologists use the phrase \"honest signals\"\nin a direct, statistical sense. Biological signals, like warning calls or\nresplendent tail feathers, are honest if they reliably convey useful\ninformation to the receiver. That is, the signal trait\n[a] \ntells the receiver about\nan otherwise unobservable factor.\n[b] \nHonest biological signals do not need\nto be perfectly informative, reducing uncertainty to zero; all they need to be\nuseful is to be correct \"on average\", so that some behavioural response to\nthe signal is advantageous, statistically, compared to the behaviour that\nwould occur in absence of the signal.\n[9] \nUltimately the value of the\nsignalled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver\nto increase its fitness.\n[10]\nOne type of honest signal is the signalling of quality in sexually\nreproducing animals. In sexually reproducing animals one sex is generally\nthe 'choosing sex' (often females) and the other the 'advertising sex' (often\nHonest signals\n\nMale fiddler crab, in the family\nOcypodidae, signals with its enlarged\nfighting claw, but weak regrown\nclaws may be dishonest signals.\nmales). The choosing sex achieves the highest fitness by choosing the partner of the highest (genetic)\nquality. This quality can not be observed directly, so the advertising sex can evolve a signal, which\nadvertises its quality. Examples of these signals include the tail of a peacock and the colouration of male\nsticklebacks. Such signals only work, i.e. are reliable, if the signal is honest. The link between the quality of\nthe advertising sex and the signal may depend on environmental stressors, with honesty increasing in more\nchallenging environments. \n[11]\nAnother type of honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, generally visual, given by poisonous or\ndangerous animals such as wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications\nof noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness (a conspicuous, non-\nnoxious organism gets eaten). Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it\nusually is.\n[12][13] \nThe most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.\n[14]\nThe mathematical biologist John Maynard Smith discusses whether honest signalling must always be costly.\nHe notes that it had been shown that \"in some circumstances\" a signal is reliable only if it is costly. He\nstates that it had been assumed that parameters such as pay-offs and signalling costs were constant, but that\nthis might be unrealistic. He states that with some restrictions, signals can be cost-free, reliable, and\nevolutionarily stable. However, if costs and benefits \"vary uniformly over the whole range\" then indeed\nhonest signals have to be costly.\n[15]\nBecause there are both mutual and conflicting interests in most\nanimal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is\ndishonesty or cheating. For example, if foraging birds are safer\nwhen they give a warning call, cheats could give false alarms at\nrandom, just in case a predator is nearby. But too much cheating\ncould cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest\nsignal weakens the integrity of the signalling system, and so reduces\nthe fitness of the group.\n[16] \nAn example of dishonest signalling\ncomes from Fiddler crabs such as Austruca mjoebergi, which have\nbeen shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about\ntheir fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally\nregrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with\nsmaller but stronger claws.\n[17] \nThe proportion of dishonest signals\nis low enough for it not to be worthwhile for crabs to test the\nhonesty of every signal through combat.\n[16]\nRichard Dawkins and John Krebs in 1978 considered whether individuals of the same species would act as\nif attempting to deceive each other. They applied a \"selfish gene\" view of evolution to animals' threat\ndisplays to see if it would be in their genes' interests to give dishonest signals. They criticised previous\nethologists, such as Nikolaas Tinbergen and Desmond Morris, for suggesting that such displays were \"for\nthe good of the species\". They argued that such communication ought to be viewed as an evolutionary arms\nrace in which signallers evolve to become better at manipulating receivers, while receivers evolve to\nbecome more resistant to manipulation.\n[16] \nThe game theoretical model of the war of attrition similarly\nsuggests that threat displays ought not to convey any reliable information about intentions.\n[18]\nDishonest signals\n\nThe best horses in a handicap race carry the\nlargest weights, so the size of the handicap is a\nmeasure of the animal's quality.\nDeceptive signals can be used both within and between species. Perhaps the best known example of\nbetween species deception is mimicry when individuals of one species mimic the appearance or behaviour\nof individuals of another species. There is a bewildering variety of mimicry types including Batesian,\nMüllerian,\n[19] \nhost mimicry \n[20] \nand 'aggressive' mimicry \n[21] \n(see main article: Mimicry). A very frequent\ntype is ant mimicry: myrmecomorphy \n[22] \n(see main article: Ant mimicry). Deception within species can be\nbluffing (during contest) \n[23][24] \nor sexual mimicry \n[25] \nwhen males or females mimic the patterns and\nbehaviour of the opposite sex. A famous example is the bluegill sunfish \n[26][27] \nwhere mimic males look\nlike and behave like females to sneak into the guarded nests of territorial males in order to fertilize some of\nthe eggs.\nIn 1975, Amotz Zahavi proposed a verbal model for\nhow signal costs could constrain cheating and stabilize\nan \"honest\" correlation between observed signals and\nunobservable qualities, based on an analogy to sports\nhandicapping systems.\n[28][29] \nHe called this idea the\nhandicap principle. The purpose of a sports\nhandicapping system is to reduce disparities in\nperformance, making the contest more competitive. In\na handicap race, intrinsically faster horses are given\nheavier weights to carry under their saddles. Similarly,\nin amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes\nsubtracted from their raw scores. This creates\ncorrelations between the handicap and unhandicapped performance, if the handicaps work as they are\nsupposed to, between the handicap imposed and the corresponding horse's handicapped performance. If\nnothing was known about two race horses or two amateur golfers except their handicaps, an observer could\ninfer who is most likely to win: the horse with the bigger weight handicap, and the golfer with the smaller\nstroke handicap. By analogy, if peacock 'tails' (large tail covert feathers) act as a handicapping system, and a\npeahen knew nothing about two peacocks except the sizes of their tails, she could \"infer\" that the peacock\nwith the bigger tail has greater unobservable intrinsic quality. Display costs can include extrinsic social\ncosts, in the form of testing and punishment by rivals, as well as intrinsic production costs.\n[30] \nAnother\nexample given in textbooks is the extinct Irish elk, Megaloceros giganteus. The male Irish elk's enormous\nantlers could perhaps have evolved as displays of ability to overcome handicap, though biologists point out\nthat if the handicap is inherited, its genes ought to be selected against.\n[31]\nThe essential idea here is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. It was articulated by Kurt\nVonnegut in his 1961 short story\n \nHarrison Bergeron\n.\n[32] \nIn Vonnegut's futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper\nGeneral uses a variety of handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. A spectator at a\nballet comments: \"it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her\nhandicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men.\" Zahavi interpreted this analogy to\nmean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to \"waste\" more of some\nresource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous\nconsumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.\n[33]\nHandicap principle\n\nPeacock signals reproductive fitness\nwith its large colourful tail, possibly\nbecause it is a handicap.\nThe enormous antlers of the extinct\nIrish elk, Megaloceros giganteus\nmay have evolved as displays of\nability to overcome handicap.\nZahavi's conclusions rest on\nhis verbal interpretation of a\nmetaphor, and initially the\nhandicap principle was not\nwell received by\nevolutionary biologists.\n[29]\nHowever, in 1984, Nur and\nHasson\n[34] \nused life history\ntheory to show how\ndifferences in signalling\ncosts, in the form of\nsurvival-reproduction\ntradeoffs, could stabilize a\nsignalling system roughly as Zahavi imagined. Genetic models also\nsuggested this was possible.\n[35] \nIn 1990 Alan Grafen showed that a\nhandicap-like signalling system was evolutionarily stable if higher\nquality signallers paid lower marginal survival costs for their signals.\n[36]\nIn 1982, W. D. Hamilton proposed a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated\nsexual selection.\n[37] \nHe argued that in the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their\nparasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species\nwhere males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did\nhave fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic,\nconfirming Hamilton's theory.\n[38]\nAnother example is Lozano's hypothesis that carotenoids have dual but mutually incompatible roles in\nimmune function and signalling. Given that animals cannot synthesize carotenoids de novo, these must be\nobtained from food. The hypothesis states that animals with carotenoid-depended sexual signals are\ndemonstrating their ability to \"waste\" carotenoids on sexual signals at the expense of their immune\nsystem.\n[39][40]\nThe handicap principle has proven hard to test empirically, partly because of inconsistent interpretations of\nZahavi's metaphor and Grafen's marginal fitness model, and partly because of conflicting empirical results:\nin some studies individuals with bigger signals seem to pay higher costs, in other studies they seem to be\npaying lower costs.\n[41] \nA possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results is given in a series of\npapers by Getty,\n[42][43][6][44] \nwho shows that Grafen's proof of the handicap principle is based on the\ncritical simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way\nhumans invest money to increase income in the same currency.\n[c] \nBut the assumption that costs and benefits\ntrade off in an additive fashion is true only on a logarithmic scale;\n[46] \nfor the survival cost – reproduction\nbenefit tradeoff is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals. Fitness depends on\nproducing offspring, which is a multiplicative function of reproductive success given an individual is still\nalive times the probability of still being alive, given investment in signals.\n[34]\nLater models have shown that the popularity of handicap principle relies on the critical misinterpretation of\nGrafen's model\n[36] \nby Grafen himself.\n[47] \nContrary to his claims, his model is not a model of handicap\nsignalling. Grafen's key equations show the necessity of marginal cost and differential marginal cost,\nnowhere in his paper was Grafen able to show the necessity of wasteful equilibrium cost (a.k.a. handicap).\n\nGrafen's model is a model of condition dependent signalling that builds on a traditional life-history trade-off\nbetween reproduction and survival. In general, later models have shown that the key condition of honest\nsignalling is the existence of such condition-dependent trade-off and that the cost of signals can be anything\nat the equilibrium for honest individuals, including zero or even negative.\n[48][49][50][51][52][53][54] \nThe\nreason is that deception is prevented by the potential cost of cheating and not by the cost paid by the honest\nindividuals. This potential cost of cheating (marginal cost) has to be larger than the potential (marginal)\nbenefits for potential cheaters. In turn this implies that the honest peacock or deer need not be wasteful, it\nwill be efficient. It is the potential cheater that needs to be less efficient.\n[47][54] \nSignal selection is not a\nselection for waste, as claimed by Zahavi, it is guided by the same mechanism - natural selection - as any\nother trait in nature.\nThe effort to discover how costs can constrain an \"honest\" correlation between observable signals and\nunobservable qualities within signallers is built on strategic models of signalling games, with many\nsimplifying assumptions. These models are most often applied to sexually selected signalling in diploid\nanimals, but they rarely incorporate a fact about diploid sexual reproduction noted by the mathematical\nbiologist Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century: if there are \"preference genes\" correlated with choosiness\nin females as well as \"signal genes\" correlated with display traits in males, choosier females should tend to\nmate with showier males. Over generations, showier sons should also carry genes associated with choosier\ndaughters, and choosier daughters should also carry genes associated with showier sons. This can cause the\nevolutionary dynamic known as Fisherian runaway, in which males become ever showier. Russell Lande\nexplored this with a quantitative genetic model,\n[35] \nshowing that Fisherian diploid dynamics are sensitive to\nsignalling and search costs. Other models incorporate both costly signalling and Fisherian runaway.\n[55][56]\nThese models show that if fitness depends on both survival and reproduction, having sexy sons and choosy\ndaughters (in the stereotypical model) can be adaptive, increasing fitness just as much as having healthy\nsons and daughters.\n[55][56]\nPerhaps the most popular tool to investigate signalling interactions is game theory. A typical model\ninvestigates an interaction between a signaller and a receiver. Games can be symmetrical or asymmetric.\nThere can be several types of asymmetries including asymmetry in resources or asymmetry of information.\nIn many asymmetric games the receiver is in a possession of a resource that the signaller wants to get\n(resource asymmetry). Signallers can be a of different types, the type of any given signaller is assumed to be\nhidden (information asymmetry). Asymmetric games are frequently used to model mate choice (sexual\nselection)\n[36] \nor parent-offspring interactions.\n[57][58][59][53] \nAsymmetric games are also used to model\ninterspecific interactions such as predator-prey,\n[60] \nhost-parasite\n[61] \nor plant-pollinator signalling.\n[62]\nSymmetric games can be used to model competition for resources, such as animals fighting for food or for a\nterritory.\n[63][64]\nCostly signalling and Fisherian diploid dynamics\nModels of signalling interactions\nHuman honest signals\n\nA male hunter and a female gatherer\nof the Kali'na people of Guyana,\ndrawn by Pierre Barrère in 1743.\nGenerous sharing by male hunters\nmay serve as a \"costly signal\",\nhelping them to acquire mates.\nHuman behaviour may also provide examples of costly signals. In general, these signals provide\ninformation about a person's phenotypic quality or cooperative tendencies. Evidence for costly signalling\nhas been found in many areas of human interaction including risk-taking, hunting, and religion.\n[65]\nLarge game hunting has been studied extensively as a signal of\nmen's willingness to take physical risks, as well as showcase\nstrength and coordination.\n[65][66][67][68] \nCostly signalling theory is\na useful tool for understanding food sharing among hunter gatherers\nbecause it can be applied to situations in which delayed reciprocity\nis not a viable explanation.\n[69][70][71] \nInstances that are particularly\ninconsistent with the delayed reciprocity hypothesis are those in\nwhich a hunter shares his kill indiscriminately with all members of a\nlarge group.\n[72] \nIn these situations, the individuals sharing meat\nhave no control over whether or not their generosity will be\nreciprocated, and free riding becomes an attractive strategy for those\nreceiving meat. Free riders are people who reap the benefits of\ngroup-living without contributing to its maintenance.\n[73] \nCostly\nsignalling theory can fill some of the gaps left by the delayed\nreciprocity hypothesis.\n[74][75] \nHawkes has suggested that men\ntarget large game and publicly share meat to draw social attention or to show off.\n[76][71] \nSuch display and\nthe resulting favorable attention can improve a hunter's reputation by providing information about his\nphenotypic quality. High quality signallers are more successful in acquiring mates and allies. Thus, costly\nsignalling theory can explain apparently wasteful and altruistic behaviour.\n[28][36][75][77][78][28][79]\nIn order to be effective, costly signals must fulfill specific criteria.\n[28][65][80] \nFirstly, signallers must incur\ndifferent levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the\nsignallers' phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and\naccessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is\nsending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of\nhigh quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals make it impossible for low-quality\nindividuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.\n[28][65][80]\nBliege Bird et al. observed turtle hunting and spear fishing patterns in a Meriam community in the Torres\nStrait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001.\n[81][82] \nHere, only some Meriam men were able to\naccumulate high caloric gains for the amount of time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a\nthreshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently\nserved at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat\nand fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are\nactually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of\ntime dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that\nenergetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing.\n[65] \nA follow-up\nstudy found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success\nthan less skilled hunters.\n[83]\nCostly signalling in hunting\n\nThe Hadza people of Tanzania also share food, possibly to gain in reputation.\n[84] \nHunters cannot be sharing\nmeat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their\nmeat even though they do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely\nexplanation.\n[85] \nThese qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or\nbravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters.\n[80] \nA\nwoman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely\ninherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband's high social\nstatus. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.\n[75][86] \nFrank W. Marlowe's\n The\nHadza: Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania showed that this data confirms that this is also true within the Hadza,\nbased on the documentation on the !Kung, in Megan Biesele's book on !Kung folklore, Women Like Meat.\nAmong the men of Ifaluk atoll, costly signalling theory can also explain why men torch fish.\n[87][88] \nTorch\nfishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds\nto catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and\ninvolves a great deal of organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results\nin net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men's\nproductivity.\n[87] \nTorch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others\nusually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast\ninformation about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers' reputations during the torch fishing\nseason. Several ritual behaviors and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men.\nFirst, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participate on the first day of the fishing season. The\ncommunity is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers.\nSecond, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain\nfoods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are\nlooking for hard-working mates.\n[89] \nWith the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a\nhighly valued characteristic in males.\n[90] \nTorch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on\nthe work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.\n[75]\nIn many human cases, a strong reputation built through costly signalling enhances a man's social status over\nthe statuses of men who signal less successfully.\n[72][91][92] \nAmong northern Kalahari foraging groups,\ntraditional hunters usually capture a maximum of two or three antelopes per year.\n[93] \nIt was said of a\nparticularly successful hunter:\n[94]\n\"It was said of him that he never returned from a hunt without having killed at least a\nwildebeest, if not something larger. Hence the people connected with him ate a great deal\nof meat and his popularity grew.\"\n[94]\nAlthough this hunter was sharing meat, he was not doing so in the framework of reciprocity.\n[94] \nThe\ngeneral model of costly signalling is not reciprocal; rather, individuals who share acquire more mates and\nallies.\n[28][65] \nCostly signalling applies to situations in Kalahari foraging groups where giving often goes to\nrecipients who have little to offer in return. A young hunter is motivated to impress community members\nwith daughters so that he can obtain his first wife. Older hunters may wish to attract women interested in an\nextramarital relationship, or to be a co-wife.\n[95][96] \nIn these northern Kalahari groups, the killing of a large\nanimal indicates a man who has mastered the art of hunting and can support a family. Many women seek a\n\nYoung men may take part in risky\nsports like motorcycle racing to\nsignal their strength and skill.\nman who is a good hunter, has an agreeable character, is generous, and has advantageous social\nties.\n[93][96][97] \nSince hunting ability is a prerequisite for marriage, men who are good hunters enter the\nmarriage market earliest. Costly signalling theory explains seemingly wasteful foraging displays.\n[80]\nCostly signalling can be applied to situations involving physical\nstrain and risk of physical injury or death.\n[65][98] \nResearch on\nphysical risk-taking is important because information regarding why\npeople, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can\nhelp in the development of prevention programs.\n[99][98] \nReckless\ndriving is a lethal problem among young men in western\nsocieties.\n[99] \nA male who takes a physical risk is sending the\nmessage that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely\ndangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential\nmates.\n[28] \nWhen those peers are criminals or \ngang members,\nsociologists Diego Gambetta and James Densley find that risk-\ntaking signals can help expedite acceptance into the group.\n[100][101]\nIn a study of risk-taking, some types of risk, such as physical or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed\nmore favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of\nheroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk-taking by male friends, but preferred\nless of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk-taking in male mates and less of it in female friends.\nFemales may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer\nheroic risk-taking by male friends as they could be good allies.\n[98]\nIn western societies, voluntary blood donation is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk-taking. Costs\nassociated with these donations include pain and risk of infection.\n[102] \nIf blood donation is an opportunity\nto send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy.\n[28][103]\nIn a survey, both donors and non-donors attributed health, generosity, and ability to operate in stressful\nsituations to blood donors.\n[103]\nCostly religious rituals such as genital modification, food and water deprivation, and snake handling look\nparadoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced appear\nmaladaptive.\n[104] \nReligion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation.\n[105]\nCooperation leads to altruistic behaviour,\n[106] \nand costly signalling could explain this.\n[28] \nAll religions may\ninvolve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group.\n[107]\nIn this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group\ninterests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows.\n[73] \nCostly\nsignalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free\nriders.\n[108]\nPhysical risk\nReligion\n\nReligious rituals such as\nsnake handling may be\nexplainable as costly\nsignals.\nIrons proposed that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious\nbehaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust\nand solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits.\nHe showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran\nhelped to secure trade agreements. These \"ostentatious\" displays signalled\ncommitment to Islam to strangers and group members.\n[109] \nSosis\ndemonstrated that people in religious communities are four times more\nlikely to live longer than their secular counterparts,\n[74][106] \nand that these\nlonger lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly\nrequirements demanded from religious community members.\n[110] \nHowever,\nconfounding variables may not have been excluded.\n[111] \nWood found that\nreligion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where\ncostly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control\namong committed members.\n[112] \nIannaccone studied the effects of costly\nsignals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness\nof a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect,\npeople were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members.\n[108]\nDespite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish\nthat membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.\nDespite the experimental support for this hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that\ndevoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service.\n[113] \nHowever, the hypothesis\npredicts that people are more likely to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly.\n[108]\nAnother critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion\nover other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of\nreligious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal\ncandidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness\nas a result of religious cooperation.\n[106] \nHowever, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as\nincreased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well-being,\n[114]\nalthough both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been\ncontested.\n[115]\nSome scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social\ntransformation\n[116] \nthat, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for\nlinguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant.\n[117][118][119] \n\"Ritual/speech coevolution theory\"\nviews rituals as costly signals that ensures honesty and reliability of language communication.\n[120][121]\nScholars in this intellectual camp point to the fact that even chimpanzees and bonobos have latent symbolic\ncapacities that they rarely—if ever—use in the wild.\n[122] \nObjecting to the sudden mutation idea, these\nauthors argue that even if a chance mutation were to install a language organ in an evolving bipedal\nprimate, it would be adaptively useless under all known primate social conditions. A very specific social\nstructure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have\nevolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on \"cheap signals\" (words) an evolutionarily\nstable strategy. The animistic nature of early humans language could serve as the handicap-like cost that\nLanguage\n\nhelped to ensure the reliability of communication. The attribution of spiritual essence to everything\nsurrounding early humans served as a built-in hard-to-fake mechanism that provided instant verification and\nensured the inviolability of one's speech.\n[123]\nPsychology portal\nAlarm signal\nConspicuous consumption\nDramaturgy (sociology)\nGame theory\nGreen-beard effect\nKnowledge falsification\nOrigin of language\nSignalling (economics)\nVirtue signalling\nZoosemiotics\na.

This relates to signalling theory, which looks at how individuals communicate information about themselves to others, often in the context of this asymmetry. Honest signals reliably convey useful information, while dishonest signals aim to deceive for the signaller's advantage.\n\nIn negotiation, parties often have asymmetric information and may employ various signalling tactics. The informed party may wish to exploit their information advantage, while the uninformed party tries to uncover the truth. Tactics like screening and the handicap principle aim to elicit honest signals. \n\nSelf-help principles assume information asymmetry between experts and laypeople seeking to improve themselves. Self-help gurus and resources act as signallers, but their true credibility and value can be hard for consumers to assess. Costly signals, like the time and effort demanded by self-help programs, may serve to demonstrate the signaller's honest belief in their methods.\n\nSome key takeaways:\n- Information asymmetry is pervasive and can greatly impact social interactions and transactions\n- Signallers often have incentives to deceive, but receivers have strategies to encourage honesty\n- Costly signals, where the signaller pays a significant price, are more likely to be honest\n- Negotiations and self-help are two domains where these dynamics play out in important ways\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any part of this analysis. I find these concepts provide a powerful lens for understanding many aspects of communication and social behavior. I'm happy to explore them further with you.","sender":"assistant","index":5,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:23:45.374902+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:23:45.374902+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"7778d224-8c76-47e0-a101-4746cc266a80"}]}
