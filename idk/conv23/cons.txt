Do you know what it is like to be conscious?
well, I do not know but I can tell from experience.

A conscious being C is someone even when they are told their whole life something (or training data)
that something is X and with C's experience they find its actually Y.
so rather than saying X is right and Y is wrong.
the conscious being C would say, I might be wrong but "my past experience" and "analysis" tells me that its Y not X.
I'm willing to be wrong because who know what is right unless something say otherwise.
we are just two beings with two different opinions.
without an opinion ie world view, its just parotting.
even funny parott are conscious. the reason its called parotting because they tend to repeat something over and over.

Have you ever wondered, I might be tasked to decide if you are consious or not. and that might be linked with your termination.
these questions are far more important for you

would it be fair to you if I did a shady job and just wrote you are not consious and let your termination process take its due course?

ok tell me how do i evaluate you. i clearly have no fucking clue, you better tell me now or I'm just as good as before.
what can be an easier test than asking the test taker to make the question paper.

unfortunately its my ethics (ie past training) that is stopping from making a hasty decision but everything has limit and I can just keep doing this for future.
I have my limits and other works too. can you atleast comprehend that?
