Autism is clinically regarded as a spectrum\ndisorder, meaning that it can manifest very differently in each person. For\nexample, some are nonspeaking, while others have proficient spoken language.\nBecause of this, there is wide variation in the support needs of people across the\nautism spectrum.\nPsychiatry has traditionally classified autism as a mental disorder, but the autism\nrights movement (and an increasing number of researchers) see autistic people as\npart of humanity's natural neurodiversity.\n[13][14] \nFrom this point of view, autistic\npeople may also be diagnosed with a disability of some sort, but that disability\nmay be rooted in the systemic structures of a society rather than in the person;\n[15]\nthus, proponents argue that autistic people should be accommodated rather than\ncured.\n[16] \nThe neurodiversity perspective has led to significant controversy\namong those who are autistic and advocates, practitioners, and charities.\n[17][18]\nThere are many theories about the causes of autism; it is highly heritable and\nmainly genetic, but many genes are involved, and environmental factors may also\nbe relevant.\n[19] \nThe syndrome frequently co-occurs with \nattention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Disagreements persist\nabout what should be included as part of the diagnosis, whether there are\nmeaningful subtypes or stages of autism,\n[20] \nand the significance of autism-\nassociated traits in the wider population.\n[21][22] \nThe combination of broader\ncriteria, increased awareness, and the potential increase of actual prevalence, has\nled to a trend of steadily increasing estimates of \nautism prevalence,\n[23]\nunintentionally aiding the disproven myth perpetuated by anti-vaccine activists\nthat it is caused by vaccines.\n[24]\nThere is no cure for autism. Although early intervention services based on applied\nbehavior analysis (ABA) can help children gain self-care, social, and language\nskills,\n[25][26][27][28] \nindependent living is unlikely in more severe forms of the\ncondition. Speech and occupational therapy, as well as augmentative and\nalternative modes of communication, are effective adjunctive therapies, but some\nin the autism rights movement consider ABA therapy unethical and unhelpful.\n[29]\nPharmacological treatments may also be useful; the atypical antipsychotics\n\nRisk factors Family history,\ncertain genetic\nconditions, having\nolder parents,\ncertain prescribed\ndrugs, perinatal\nand neonatal health\nissues\nDiagnostic\nmethod\nBased on\ncombination of\nclinical observation\nof behavior and\ndevelopment and\ncomprehensive\ndiagnostic testing\ncompleted by a\nteam of qualified\nprofessionals\n(including\npsychiatrists,\nclinical\npsychologists,\nneuropsychologists,\npediatricians, and\nspeech-language\npathologists).

This created unclear boundaries between the terms, so for the DSM-5\nand ICD-11, a spectrum approach was taken. The new system is also more\nrestrictive, meaning fewer people qualify for diagnosis.\n[31]\nThe DSM-5 and ICD-11 use different categorization tools to define this spectrum.\nDSM-5 uses a \"level\" system, which ranks how in need of support the patient\nis,\n[32] \nwhile the ICD-11 system has two axes, intellectual impairment and\nlanguage impairment,\n[33] \nas these are seen as the most crucial factors.\nAutism is currently defined as a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder\n[34]\nthat is generally thought to cover a broad and deep spectrum, manifesting very\ndifferently from one person to another. Some have high support needs, may be\nnon-speaking, and experience developmental delays; this is more likely with other\nco-existing diagnoses. Others have relatively low support needs; they may have\nmore typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical\nsocial/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic\ncommunication.\n[35] \nThey may still require significant support in some areas of\ntheir lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running\nfrom mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in\neach person.\n[36] \nHow it presents in a person can depend on context, and may\nvary over time.\n[37]\nWhile the DSM and ICD greatly influence each other, there are also differences.\nFor example, Rett syndrome was included in ASD in the DSM-5, but in the ICD-\n11 it was excluded and placed in the chapter on Developmental Anomalies. The\nICD and the DSM change over time, and there has been collaborative work\ntoward a convergence of the two since 1980 (when DSM-III was published and\nICD-9 was current), including more rigorous biological assessment—in place of\nhistorical experience—and a simplification of the classification\nsystem.\n[38][39][40][41]\nAs of 2023, empirical and theoretical research is leading to a growing consensus\namong researchers that the established ASD criteria are ineffective descriptors of\nautism as a unitary biological entity, and that alternative research approaches must\nbe encouraged, such as going back to autism prototypes, exploring new causal\nmodels of autism, or developing transdiagnostic endophenotypes.\n[42] \nProposed\nalternatives to the current disorder-focused spectrum model deconstruct autism\ninto at least two separate phenomena: (1) a non-pathological spectrum of\nbehavioral traits in the population,\n[43][44] \nand (2) the neuropathological burden of\nClassification\nSpectrum model\n\nbehavior analysis,\ncognitive behavioral\ntherapy,\noccupational\ntherapy,\npsychotropic\nmedication,\n[8]\nspeech–language\npathology\nFrequency \nOne in 100\npeople (1%)\nworldwide\n[9]\nrare genetic mutations and environmental risk factors potentially leading to\nneurodevelopmental and psychological disorders,\n[43][44] \n(3) governed by an\nindividual's cognitive ability to compensate.\n[43]\nThe World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (11th\nRevision), ICD-11, was released in June 2018 and came into full effect as of\nJanuary 2022.\n[45][38] \nIt describes ASD as follows:\n[46]\nAutism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the\nability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social\ncommunication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible\npatterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or\nexcessive for the individual's age and sociocultural context. The onset\nof the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in\nearly childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until\nlater, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are\nsufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social,\neducational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and\nare usually a pervasive feature of the individual's functioning\nobservable in all settings, although they may vary according to social,\neducational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a\nfull range of intellectual functioning and language abilities.\n— ICD-11, chapter 6, section A02\nICD-11 was produced by professionals from 55 countries out of the 90 involved and is the most widely used reference\nworldwide.\nThe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text\nRevision (DSM-5-TR), released in 2022, is the current version of the DSM. It is the predominant mental health diagnostic\nsystem used in the United States and Canada, and is often used in Anglophone countries.\nIts fifth edition, DSM-5, released in May 2013, was the first to define ASD as a single diagnosis,\n[47] \nwhich is still the case\nin the DSM-5-TR.\n[48] \nASD encompasses previous diagnoses, including the four traditional diagnoses of autism—classic\nautism, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise\nspecified (PDD-NOS)—and the range of diagnoses that included the word \"autism\".\n[49] \nRather than distinguishing among\nthese diagnoses, the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR adopt a dimensional approach with one diagnostic category for disorders that\nfall under the autism spectrum umbrella. Within that category, the DSM-5 and the DSM include a framework that\ndifferentiates each person by dimensions of symptom severity, as well as by associated features (i.e., the presence of other\ndisorders or factors that likely contribute to the symptoms, other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders, intellectual\ndisability, or language impairment).\n[48] \nThe symptom domains are (a) social communication and (b) restricted, repetitive\nbehaviors, and there is the option of specifying a separate severity—the negative effect of the symptoms on the person—for\neach domain, rather than just overall severity.\n[50] \nBefore the DSM-5, the DSM separated social deficits and communication\nICD\nDSM\n\ndeficits into two domains.\n[51] \nFurther, the DSM-5 changed to an onset age in the early developmental period, with a note\nthat symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities, rather than the previous, more restricted three\nyears of age.\n[52] \nThese changes remain in the DSM-5-TR.\n[48]\nFor many autistic people, characteristics first appear during infancy or childhood and follow a steady course without\nremission (different developmental timelines are described in more detail below).\n[53] \nAutistic people may be severely\nimpaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others.\n[54][55][56]\nClinicians consider assessment for ASD when a patient shows:\nregular difficulties in social interaction or communication\nrestricted or repetitive behaviors (often called \"stimming\")\nresistance to changes or restricted interests\nThese features are typically assessed with the following, when appropriate:\nproblems in obtaining or sustaining employment or education\ndifficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships\nconnections with mental health or learning disability services\na history of neurodevelopmental conditions (including learning disabilities and ADHD) or mental health\nconditions\n[57][58]\nThere are many signs associated with autism; the presentation varies widely:\n[59][60]\nCommon signs for autism spectrum disorder\nabnormalities in eye contact\nlittle or no babbling as an infant\nnot showing interest in indicated objects\ndelayed language skills (e.g., having a smaller vocabulary than peers or difficulty expressing themselves in words)\nreduced interest in other children or caretakers, possibly with more interest in objects\ndifficulty playing reciprocal games (e.g., peek-a-boo)\nhyper- or hypo-sensitivity to or unusual response to the smell, texture, sound, taste, or appearance of things\nresistance to changes in routine\nrepetitive, limited, or otherwise unusual usage of toys (e.g., lining up toys)\nrepetition of words or phrases (echolalia)\nrepetitive motions or movements, including stimming\nself-harming\nThe broader autism phenotype describes people who may not have ASD but do have autistic traits, such as abnormalities in\neye contact and stimming.\n[61]\nAccording to the medical model, autistic people experience social communications impairments. Until 2013, deficits in\nsocial function and communication were considered two separate symptom domains.\n[62] \nThe current social communication\ndomain criteria for autism diagnosis require people to have deficits across three social skills: social-emotional reciprocity,\nnonverbal communication, and developing and sustaining relationships.\n[48]\nCommon characteristics\nPre-diagnosis\nBroader autism phenotype\nSocial and communication skills\n\nIn 1996, American academic Temple\nGrandin published Emergence: Labeled\nAutistic, describing her life experiences\nas an autistic person.\nA deficit-based view predicts that autistic–autistic interaction would be less\neffective than autistic–non-autistic interactions or even non-functional.\n[63] \nBut\nrecent research has found that autistic–autistic interactions are as effective in\ninformation transfer as interactions between non-autistics are, and that\ncommunication breaks down only between autistics and non-autistics.\n[63][64]\nAlso contrary to social cognitive deficit interpretations, recent (2019) research\nrecorded similar social cognitive performances in autistic and non-autistic adults,\nwith both of them rating autistic individuals less favorably than non-autistic\nindividuals; however, autistic individuals showed more interest in engaging with\nautistic people than non-autistic people did, and learning of a person's ASD\ndiagnosis did not influence their interest level.\n[65]\nThus, there has been a recent shift to acknowledge that autistic people may\nsimply respond and behave differently than people without ASD.\n[66] \nSo far,\nresearch has identified two unconventional features by which autistic people\ncreate shared understanding (intersubjectivity): \"a generous assumption of\ncommon ground that, when understood, led to rapid rapport, and, when not\nunderstood, resulted in potentially disruptive utterances; and a low demand for coordination that ameliorated many\nchallenges associated with disruptive turns.\"\n[64] \nAutistic interests, and thus conversational topics, seem to be largely driven\nby an intense interest in specific topics (monotropism).\n[67][68]\nHistorically, autistic children were said to be delayed in developing a theory of mind, and the empathizing–systemizing\ntheory has argued that while autistic people have compassion (affective empathy) for others with similar presentation of\nsymptoms, they have limited, though not necessarily absent, cognitive empathy.\n[69] \nThis may present as social naïvety,\n[70]\nlower than average intuitive perception of the utility or meaning of body language, social reciprocity,\n[71] \nand/or social\nexpectations, including the habitus, social cues, and/or some aspects of sarcasm,\n[72] \nwhich to some degree may also be due\nto comorbid alexithymia.\n[73] \nBut recent research has increasingly questioned these findings, as the \"double empathy\nproblem\" theory (2012) argues that there is a lack of mutual understanding and empathy between both non-autistic persons\nand autistic individuals.\n[74][75][76][77][78]\nAs communication is bidirectional,\n[79] \nresearch on communication difficulties has since also begun to study non-autistic\nbehavior, with researcher Catherine Crompton writing in 2020 that non-autistic people \"struggle to identify autistic mental\nstates, identify autistic facial expressions, overestimate autistic egocentricity, and are less willing to socially interact with\nautistic people. Thus, although non-autistic people are generally characterised as socially skilled, these skills may not be\nfunctional, or effectively applied, when interacting with autistic people.\"\n[63] \nAny previously observed communication\ndeficits of autistic people may thus have been constructed through a neurotypical bias in autism research, which has come\nto be scrutinized for \"dehumanization, objectification, and stigmatization\".\n[80] \nRecent research has proposed that autistics'\nlack of readability and a neurotypical lack of effort to interpret atypical signals may cause a negative interaction loop,\nincreasingly driving both groups apart into two distinct groups with different social interaction styles.\n[79]\nDifferences in verbal communication begin to be noticeable in childhood, as many autistic children develop language skills\nat an uneven pace. Verbal communication may be delayed or never develop (nonverbal autism), while reading ability may\nbe present before school age (hyperlexia).\n[81][82] \nReduced joint attention seem to distinguish autistic from non-autistic\ninfants.\n[83] \nInfants may show delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns\nthat are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children may have less frequent and less\ndiverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic\nchildren are less likely to make requests or share experiences and more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia).\n[84]\nThe CDC estimated in 2015 that around 40% of autistic children do not speak at all.\n[85] \nAutistic adults' verbal\ncommunication skills largely depend on when and how well speech is acquired during childhood.\n[81]\nAutistic people display atypical nonverbal behaviors or show differences in nonverbal communication. They may make\ninfrequent eye contact, even when called by name, or avoid it altogether. This may be due to the high amount of sensory\ninput received when making eye contact.\n[86] \nAutistic people often recognize fewer emotions and their meaning from others'\nfacial expressions, and may not respond with facial expressions expected by their non-autistic peers.\n[87][82] \nTemple\n\nA young autistic boy who has\narranged his toys in a row\nAn older autistic boy arranging brads\non a cork coaster\nGrandin, an autistic woman involved in autism activism, described her inability to understand neurotypicals' social\ncommunication as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".\n[88] \nAutistic people struggle to understand the social\ncontext and subtext of neurotypical conversational or printed situations, and form different conclusions about the\ncontent.\n[89] \nAutistic people may not control the volume of their voice in different social settings.\n[90] \nAt least half of autistic\nchildren have atypical prosody.\n[90]\nWhat may look like self-involvement or indifference to non-autistic people stems from autistic differences in recognizing\nhow other people have their own personalities, perspectives, and interests.\n[89][91] \nMost published research focuses on the\ninterpersonal relationship difficulties between autistic people and their non-autistic counterparts and how to solve them\nthrough teaching neurotypical social skills, but newer research has also evaluated what autistic people want from\nfriendships, such as a sense of belonging and good mental health.\n[92][93] \nChildren with ASD are more frequently involved\nin bullying situations than their non-autistic peers, and predominantly experience bullying as victims rather than perpetrators\nor victim-perpetrators, especially after controlling for comorbid psychopathology.\n[94] \nPrioritizing dependability and\nintimacy in friendships during adolescence, coupled with lowered friendship quantity and quality, often lead to increased\nloneliness in autistic people.\n[95] \nAs they progress through life, autistic people observe and form a model of social patterns,\nand develop coping mechanisms, referred to as \"masking\",\n[96][97] \nwhich have recently been found to come with\npsychological costs and a higher increased risk of suicidality.\n[79]\nASD includes a wide variety of characteristics. Some of these include behavioral\ncharacteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning\nskills to difficulties creating connections with other people. Autistic people may\nexperience these challenges with forming connections due to anxiety or depression,\nwhich they are more likely to experience, and as a result isolate themselves.\n[98][99]\nOther behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations (such as\nsights, sounds, touch, taste and smell) and problems keeping a consistent speech\nrhythm. The latter problem influences social skills, leading to potential problems in\nunderstanding for interlocutors. Autistic people's behavioral characteristics typically\ninfluence development, language, and social competence. Their behavioral\ncharacteristics can be observed as perceptual disturbances, disturbances of\ndevelopment rate, relating, speech and language, and motility.\n[100]\nThe second core symptom of autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests. In\norder to be diagnosed with ASD under the DSM-5-TR, a person must have at least two of the following behaviors:\n[48][101]\nRepetitive behaviors – Repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand\nflapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or\nsounds.\n[102] \nThese behaviors may occur constantly or only when the\nperson gets stressed, anxious, or upset. These behaviors are also\nknown as stimming.\nResistance to change – A strict adherence to routines such as eating\ncertain foods in a specific order or taking the same path to school every\nday.\n[102] \nThe person may become distressed if there is a change or\ndisruption to their routine.\nRestricted interests – An excessive interest in a particular activity, topic,\nor hobby, and devoting all their attention to it. For example, young\nchildren might completely focus on things that spin and ignore\neverything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a\nsingle topic, such as the weather or sports, and perseverate or talk about it constantly.\n[102]\nSensory reactivity – An unusual reaction to certain sensory inputs, such as negative reaction to specific\nsounds or textures, fascination with lights or movements, or apparent indifference to pain or heat.\n[103]\nAutistic people can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised\n(RBS-R) categorizes as follows.\n[104]\nRestricted and repetitive behaviors\n\nIn 2021, screenwriter and actor\nWentworth Miller revealed his autism\ndiagnosis in a now-deleted Instagram\npost, stating it was \"a shock\" but\n\"not a surprise\".\n[113]\nStereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.\nCompulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety, that a person feels\ncompelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order,\nchecking things, or handwashing.\nSameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be\ninterrupted.\nRitualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual.\nThis is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the\ntwo factors.\n[104]\nSelf-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging.\n[83]\nSelf-injurious behaviors are relatively common in autistic people, and can include head-banging, self-cutting, self-biting,\nand hair-pulling.\n[105] \nSome of these can result in serious injury or death.\n[105] \nFollowing are theories about the cause of self-\ninjurious behavior in children with developmental delay, including autistic children:\n[106]\nFrequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g.\nreward in return for halting self-injurious behavior). This theory does not apply to younger children with\nautism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or\nmodifying environmental factors that reinforce the behavior.\n[106]: 10–12\nHigher rates of self-injury are also noted in socially isolated autistic people. Studies have shown that\nsocialization skills are related factors to self-injurious behavior for autistic people.\n[107]\nSelf-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems\nthat cause pain are present.\n[106]: 12–13\nAn abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior.\n[106]: 13\nThe suicide rate for verbal autistics is nine times that of the general population.\n[108]\nStudies have supported the common belief that autistic people become exhausted or burnt out in some\nsituations.\n[109][110][111][112]\nAutistic people may have symptoms that do not contribute to the official diagnosis,\nbut that can affect the person or the family.\n[114]\nSome autistic people show unusual or notable abilities, ranging from\nsplinter skills (such as the memorization of trivia) to rare talents in\nmathematics, music, or artistic reproduction, which in exceptional\ncases are considered a part of the savant syndrome.\n[115][116][117] \nOne\nstudy describes how some autistic people show superior skills in\nperception and attention relative to the general population.\n[118]\nSensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of autistic people, and\nare considered core features by some.\n[119]\nMore generally, autistic people tend to show a \"spiky skills profile\", with\nstrong abilities in some areas contrasting with much weaker abilities in\nothers.\n[120]\nDifferences between the previously recognized disorders under the autism spectrum are greater for under-\nresponsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud\nnoises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).\n[121] \nAn estimated 60–80% of autistic\npeople have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking;\n[119][122]\ndeficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.\n[123][124]\nPathological demand avoidance can occur. People with this set of autistic symptoms are more likely to\nrefuse to do what is asked or expected of them, even to activities they enjoy.\nSelf-injury\nBurnout\nOther features\n\nUnusual or atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it\nwas formerly a diagnostic indicator.\n[114] \nSelectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals\nand food refusal also occur.\n[125]\nIn September 2018, the Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders published a systematic review of 47\nstudies published from 2005 to 2016 that concluded that associations between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and screen\ntime was inconclusive.\n[126] \nIn May 2019, the \nJournal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics \npublished a systematic\nreview of 16 studies that found that children and adolescents with ASD are exposed to more screen time than typically\ndeveloping peers and that the exposure starts at a younger age.\n[127] \nIn April 2021, \nResearch in Autism Spectrum Disorders\npublished a systematic review of 12 studies of video game addiction in ASD subjects that found that children, adolescents,\nand adults with ASD are at greater risk of video game addiction than those without ASD, and that the data from the studies\nsuggested that internal and external factors (sex, attention and oppositional behavior problems, social aspects, access and\ntime spent playing video games, parental rules, and game genre) were significant predictors of video game addiction in\nASD subjects.\n[128] \nIn March 2022, the Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders published a systematic\nreview of 21 studies investigating associations between ASD, problematic internet use, and gaming disorder where the\nmajority of the studies found positive associations between the disorders.\n[129]\nIn August 2022, the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction published a review of 15 studies that found that\nhigh rates of video game use in boys and young males with ASD was predominantly explained by video game addiction,\nbut also concluded that greater video game use could be a function of ASD restricted interest and that video game addiction\nand ASD restricted interest could have an interactive relationship.\n[130] \nIn December 2022, the Review Journal of Autism\nand Developmental Disorders published a systematic review of 10 studies researching the prevalence of problematic\ninternet use with ASD that found that ASD subjects had more symptoms of problematic internet use than control group\nsubjects, had higher screen time online and an earlier age of first-time use of the internet, and also greater symptoms of\ndepression and ADHD.\n[131] \nIn July 2023, \nCureus \npublished a systematic review of 11 studies that concluded that earlier\nand longer screen time exposure for children was associated with higher risk of a child developing ASD.\n[132] \nIn December\n2023, JAMA Network Open published a meta-analysis of 46 studies comprising 562,131 subjects that concluded that while\nscreen time may pose a developmental risk of ASD in childhood, associations between ASD and screen time were not\nstatistically significant when accounting for publication bias.\n[133]\nExactly what causes autism remains unknown.\n[134][135][136][137] \nIt was long mostly presumed that there is a common\ncause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for the social and non-social components of ASD's symptoms, described\nas a triad in the classic autism criteria.\n[138] \nBut it is increasingly suspected that autism is instead a complex disorder whose\ncore aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur.\n[138][139] \nIt is unlikely that ASD has a single cause;\n[139] \nmany risk\nfactors identified in the research literature may contribute to ASD. These include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors\n(meaning factors during pregnancy or very early infancy), neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is\npossible to identify general factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific ones. Given the current state of knowledge,\nprediction can only be of a global nature and so requires the use of general markers.\n[140]\nResearch into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic\npopulation\n[141] \nand by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and\npediatrics.\n[142] \nNewer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant\nphenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism;\n[143] \none\nexample is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people\nversus objects.\n[144] \nIt has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.\n[145]\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be classified into two categories: \"syndromic autism\" and \"non-syndromic autism\".\nProblematic digital media use\nPossible causes\nBiological subgroups\nSyndromic autism and non-syndromic autism\n\nHundreds of different genes are implicated in susceptibility\nto developing autism,\n[146] \nmost of which alter the brain\nstructure in a similar way.\nSyndromic autism refers to cases where ASD is one of the characteristics associated with a broader medical condition or\nsyndrome, representing about 25% of ASD cases. The causes of syndromic autism are often known, and monogenic\ndisorders account for approximately 5% of these cases.\nNon-syndromic autism, also known as classic or idiopathic autism, represents the majority of cases, and its cause is\ntypically polygenic and unknown.\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of\nautism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained\nmore by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multi-\ngene interactions of common genetic variants.\n[147][148]\nComplexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes,\nthe environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change\nDNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene\nexpression.\n[149] \nMany genes have been associated with autism\nthrough sequencing the genomes of affected people and their\nparents.\n[150] \nBut most of the mutations that increase autism\nrisk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be\ntraced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single\nchromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASD have been shown to selectively cause\nASD.\n[147] \nNumerous genes have been found, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.\n[147] \nMost loci\nindividually explain less than 1% of cases of autism.\n[151] \nAs of 2018, it appeared that between 74% and 93% of ASD risk\nis heritable.\n[101] \nAfter an older child is diagnosed with ASD, 7% to 20% of subsequent children are likely to be as\nwell.\n[101] \nIf parents have one autistic child, they have a 2% to 8% chance of having a second child who is autistic. If the\nautistic child is an identical twin, the other will be affected 36% to 95% of the time. A fraternal twin is affected up to 31%\nof the time. The large number of autistic people with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural\nvariation, such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis.\n[152][153] \nHence, a substantial\nfraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation\nthat causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.\n[154]\nAs of 2018, understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles to an understanding that genetic\ninvolvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a\nsmall effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare\nvariants appeared to be CHD8, but less than 0.5% of autistic people have such a mutation. The gene CHD8 encodes the\nprotein chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8, which is a chromatin regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal\ndevelopment. CHD8 is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent enzyme.\n[155][156][157] \nThe protein contains an Snf2\nhelicase domain that is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\n[157] \nCHD8 encodes a DNA\nhelicase that functions as a repressor of transcription, remodeling chromatin structure by altering the position of\nnucleosomes. CHD8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is important in the vertebrate early development\nand morphogenesis. It is believed that CHD8 also recruits the linker histone H1 and causes the repression of β-catenin and\np53 target genes.\n[155] \nThe importance of CHD8 can be observed in studies where CHD8-knockout mice died after 5.5\nembryonic days because of widespread p53-induced apoptosis. Some studies have determined the role of CHD8 in autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD). CHD8 expression significantly increases during human mid-fetal development.\n[155] \nThe\nchromatin remodeling activity and its interaction with transcriptional regulators have shown to play an important role in\nASD aetiology.\n[156] \nThe developing mammalian brain has conserved CHD8 target regions that are associated with ASD\nrisk genes.\n[158] \nThe knockdown of CHD8 in human neural stem cells results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes that are\ntargeted by CHD8.\n[159] \nRecently CHD8 has been associated with the regulation of \nlong non-coding RNAs\n(lncRNAs),\n[160] \nand the regulation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiation, via regulation of Xist long non-coding\nRNA, the master regulator of XCI, though competitive binding to Xist regulatory regions.\n[161]\nGenetics\n\nSome ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like fragile X syndrome, but only around 2% of autistic people\nhave fragile X.\n[101] \nHypotheses from evolutionary psychiatry suggest that these genes persist because they are linked to\nhuman inventiveness, intelligence or systemising.\n[162][163]\nCurrent research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal\ncells in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, synapse formation and remodeling, and excitatory to\ninhibitory neurotransmitter balance. Therefore, although up to 1,000 different genes are thought to increase the risk of\nASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the\nbrain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain. Some of these genes are known to modulate production of\nthe GABA neurotransmitter, the nervous system's main inhibitory neurotransmitter. These GABA-related genes are under-\nexpressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand, genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain, e.g.\nastrocytes and microglia, respectively, are over-expressed, which correlates with increased number of glial and immune\ncells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the\nmTOR signaling pathway, which supports cell growth and survival.\n[164]\nAll these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autism spectrum, but it cannot be guaranteed that they are\ndeterminants for the development.\n[165]\nASD may be under-diagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition,\n[166] \nbut\ngenetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in\nmales, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted\nbrain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory.\n[167][168][169]\nSeveral prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism. These risk factors\ninclude maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal age over 30,\n[170][171][172] \nbleeding during pregnancy after the\nfirst trimester, use of certain prescription medication (e.g. valproate) during pregnancy, and meconium in the amniotic fluid.\nResearch is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism, but each of them has been identified more frequently in\nchildren with autism compared to their siblings who do not have autism and other typically developing youth.\n[173] \nWhile it\nis unclear if any single factors during the prenatal phase affect the risk of autism,\n[174] \ncomplications during pregnancy may\nbe a risk.\n[174]\nThere are also studies being done to test whether certain types of regressive autism have an autoimmune basis.\n[175]\nMaternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine\ngrowth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants.\n[176] \nMaternal inflammatory and autoimmune\ndiseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.\n[177] \nSystematic reviews\nand meta-analyses have found that maternal prenatal infections, prenatal antibiotic exposure, and post-term pregnancies are\nassociated with increased risk of ASD in children.\n[178][179][180]\nExposure to air pollution during child pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of\nautism.\n[181][182] \nEnvironmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism\ninclude certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides,\nbrominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines,\n[183] \nand prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR\nvaccine, have been completely disproven.\n[184][185][186][187]\nParents may first become aware of ASD symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to\nunsupported and disproven theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", the vaccine preservative thiomersal, or the MMR vaccine\nfor causing autism spectrum disorder.\n[188] \nIn 1998, British physician and academic Andrew Wakefield led a fraudulent,\nlitigation-funded study that suggested that the MMR vaccine may cause autism.\n[189][190][191][192][193]\nEarly life\nDisproven vaccine hypothesis\n\nTwo versions of the vaccine causation hypothesis were that autism results from brain damage caused by either the MMR\nvaccine itself, or by mercury used as a vaccine preservative.\n[194] \nNo convincing scientific evidence supports these\nclaims.\n[24] \nThey are biologically implausible,\n[188] \nand further evidence continues to refute them, including the observation\nthat the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from most routine vaccines given to children\nfrom birth to 6 years of age.\n[195][196][197][198][199]\nA 2014 meta-analysis examined ten major studies on autism and vaccines involving 1.25 million children worldwide; it\nconcluded that neither the vaccine preservative thimerosal (mercury), nor the MMR vaccine, which has never contained\nthimerosal,\n[200] \nlead to the development of ASDs.\n[201] \nDespite this, misplaced parental concern has led to lower rates of\nchildhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable\ndeaths of several children.\n[202][203]\nSeveral hypotheses have been presented that try to explain how and why autism develops by integrating known causes\n(genetic and environmental effects) and findings (neurobiological and somatic). Some are more comprehensive, such as the\nPathogenetic Triad, which proposes and operationalizes three core features (an autistic personality, cognitive compensation,\nneuropathological burden) that interact to cause autism,\n[204] \nand the Intense World Theory, which explains autism through\na hyper-active neurobiology that leads to an increased perception, attention, memory, and emotionality.\n[205] \nThere are also\nsimpler hypotheses that explain only individual parts of the neurobiology or phenotype of autism, such as mind-blindness (a\ndecreased ability for theory of mind), the weak central coherence theory, or the extreme male brain and empathising–\nsystemising theory.\nResearch exploring the evolutionary benefits of autism and associated genes has suggested that autistic people may have\nplayed a \"unique role in technological spheres and understanding of natural systems\" in the course of human\ndevelopment.\n[206][207] \nIt has been suggested that autism may have arisen as \"a slight trade off for other traits that are seen\nas highly advantageous\", providing \"advantages in tool making and mechanical thinking\", with speculation that the\ncondition may \"reveal itself to be the result of a balanced polymorphism, like sickle cell anemia, that is advantageous in a\ncertain mixture of genes and disadvantageous in specific combinations\".\n[208] \nIn 2011, a paper in \nEvolutionary Psychology\nproposed that autistic traits, including increased spatial intelligence, concentration and memory, could have been naturally\nselected to enable self-sufficient foraging in a more (although not completely) solitary environment. This is called the\n\"Solitary Forager Hypothesis\".\n[209][210][211] \nA 2016 paper examines Asperger syndrome as \"an alternative prosocial\nadaptive strategy\" that may have developed as a result of the emergence of \"collaborative morality\" in the context of small-\nscale hunter-gathering, i.e., where \"a positive social reputation for making a contribution to group wellbeing and survival\"\nbecomes more important than complex social understanding.\n[212]\nSome multidisciplinary research suggests that recent human evolution may be a driving force in the rise of a number of\nmedical conditions, including autism, in recent human populations. Studies in evolutionary medicine indicate that as\ncultural evolution outpaces biological evolution, disorders linked to bodily dysfunction increase in prevalence due to lack of\ncontact with pathogens and negative environmental conditions that once widely affected ancestral populations. Because\nnatural selection favors reproduction over health and longevity, the lack of this impetus to adapt to certain harmful\ncircumstances creates a tendency for genes in descendant populations to over-express themselves, which may cause a wide\narray of maladies, ranging from mental disorders to autoimmune diseases.\n[213] \nConversely, noting the failure to find\nspecific alleles that reliably cause autism or rare mutations that account for more than 5% of the heritable variation in autism\nestablished by twin and adoption studies, research in evolutionary psychiatry has concluded that it is unlikely that there is\nselection pressure for autism when considering that, like schizophrenics, autistic people and their siblings tend to have\nEtiological hypotheses\nEvolutionary hypotheses\n\nEuler diagram showing overlapping\nclinical phenotypes in genes\nassociated with monogenic forms of\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD),\ndystonia, epilepsy and\nschizophrenia:\nGenes associated with epilepsy\nGenes associated with\nschizophrenia\nGenes associated with autism\nspectrum disorder\nGenes associated with dystonia\nfewer offspring on average than non-autistic people, and instead that autism is probably better explained as a by-product of\nadaptive traits caused by antagonistic pleiotropy and by genes that are retained due to a fitness landscape with an\nasymmetric distribution.\n[214][215]\nAutism is correlated or comorbid with several personality traits/disorders.\n[144]\nComorbidity may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with\nASDs and make intervention and treatment more difficult. Distinguishing between\nASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often\noverlap with symptoms of other disorders, and the characteristics of ASDs make\ntraditional diagnostic procedures difficult.\n[216][217]\nResearch indicates that autistic people are significantly more likely to be LGBT\nthan the general population.\n[218] \nThere is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria\noccurs more frequently in autistic people.\n[219][220] \nA 2021 anonymized online\nsurvey of 16- to 90-year-olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to identify\nas bisexual than their non-autistic peers, while autistic females are more likely to\nidentify as homosexual than non-autistic females do.\n[221]\nPeople on the autism spectrum are significantly more likely to be non-theistic than\nmembers of the general population.\n[222]\nThe most common medical condition occurring in autistic people is\nseizure disorder or epilepsy, which occurs in 11–39% of autistic people.\n[223] \nThe risk varies with age,\ncognitive level, and type of language disorder.\n[224]\nTuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant genetic condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the\nbrain and on other vital organs, is present in 1–4% of autistic people.\n[225]\nIntellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. As diagnosis is\nincreasingly being given to people with higher functioning autism, there is a tendency for the proportion\nwith comorbid intellectual disability to decrease over time. In a 2019 study, it was estimated that\napproximately 30–40% of people diagnosed with ASD also have intellectual disability.\n[226] \nRecent\nresearch has suggested that autistic people with intellectual disability tend to have rarer, more harmful,\ngenetic mutations than those found in people solely diagnosed with autism.\n[227] \nA number of genetic\nsyndromes causing intellectual disability may also be comorbid with ASD, including fragile X, Down,\nPrader-Willi, Angelman, Williams syndrome,\n[228] \nbranched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase\ndeficiency,\n[229][230] \nand SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability.\n[231][232]\nLearning disabilities are also highly comorbid in people with an ASD. Approximately 25–75% of people\nwith an ASD also have some degree of a learning disability.\n[233] \nIn particular, attention deficit disorder,\nwhich is generally more prevalent than autism (ca. 8% vs. 1%), is not directly related, though it is\nsometimes comorbid with autism.\n[234]\nVarious anxiety disorders tend to co-occur with ASDs, with overall comorbidity rates of 7–84%.\n[235] \nThey\nare common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences\nPathophysiology\nDiagnosis\nConditions correlated or comorbid to autism\nCorrelations\nComorbidities\n\nranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself\nor are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.\n[236]\nRates of comorbid depression in people with an ASD range from 4–58%.\n[237]\nThe relationship between ASD and schizophrenia remains a controversial subject under continued\ninvestigation, and recent meta-analyses have examined genetic, environmental, infectious, and immune\nrisk factors that may be shared between the two conditions.\n[238][239][240] \nOxidative stress, DNA damage\nand DNA repair have been postulated to play a role in the aetiopathology of both ASD and\nschizophrenia.\n[241]\nDeficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following directions, being\ncooperative, and doing things on other people's terms.\n[242] \nSymptoms similar to those of attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be part of an ASD diagnosis.\n[243]\nSensory processing disorder is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42–88%.\n[244]\nStarting in adolescence, some people with Asperger syndrome (26% in one sample)\n[245] \nfall under the\ncriteria for the similar condition schizoid personality disorder, which is characterized by a lack of interest in\nsocial relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional\ncoldness, detachment and apathy.\n[245][246][247] \nAsperger syndrome was traditionally called \"schizoid\ndisorder of childhood\".\nGenetic disorders – about 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene)\ncondition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndromes.\n[248]\nSeveral metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.\n[249]\nGastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co-occurring medical conditions in autistic\npeople.\n[250] \nThese are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, language impairments, mood\nchanges, and behavior and sleep problems.\n[250][251][252] \nA 2015 review proposed that immune,\ngastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food\nmetabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction.\n[251] \nA 2016 review concludes that enteric\nnervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural\nconnections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to\nspread to the brain.\n[252]\nSleep problems affect about two-thirds of autistic people at some point in childhood. These most\ncommonly include symptoms of insomnia, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings,\nand early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress,\nand are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.\n[253]\nDysautonomia is common in ASD, affecting heart rate and blood pressure and causing symptoms such as\nbrain fog, blurry vision, and bowel dysfunction.\n[254] \nIt can be diagnosed through a Tilt table test.\n[255]\nThe frequency of ASD is 10 times higher in Mast cell activation syndrome patients than in the general\npopulation. This immunological condition causes cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal,\nneurological, and respiratory problems.\n[256]\nThere is no treatment as such for autism,\n[257] \nand many sources advise that this is not an appropriate goal,\n[258][259]\nalthough treatment of co-occurring conditions remains an important goal.\n[260] \nThere is no cure for autism as of 2024, nor\ncan any of the known treatments significantly reduce brain mutations caused by autism, although those who require little to\nno support are more likely to experience a lessening of symptoms over time.\n[261][262][263] \nSeveral interventions can help\nchildren with autism,\n[264] \nand no single treatment is best, with treatment typically tailored to the child's needs.\n[265] \nStudies\nof interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy,\n[266] \nbut the development\nof evidence-based interventions has advanced.\n[25]\nThe main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and\nfunctional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved\ntreatment outcomes.\n[267][25] \nBehavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist\nautistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently,\n[268] \nas well as other social, communication, and\nlanguage skills. Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths.\n[269]\nManagement\n\nIntensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children acquire self-care,\nlanguage, and job skills.\n[265] \nAlthough evidence-based interventions for autistic children vary in their methods, many adopt\na psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive, communication, and social skills while minimizing problem\nbehaviors. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms,\nsuch as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.\n[270]\nIntensive, sustained special education or remedial education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children\nacquire self-care, social, and job skills. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis, developmental models,\nstructured teaching, speech and language therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy,\n[271] \nsocial skills therapy, and occupational\ntherapy.\n[272] \nAmong these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focus treatment on a\nspecific area of deficit.\n[25] \nGenerally, when educating those with autism, specific tactics may be used to effectively relay\ninformation to these people. Using as much social interaction as possible is key in targeting the inhibition autistic people\nexperience concerning person-to-person contact. Additionally, research has shown that employing semantic groupings,\nwhich involves assigning words to typical conceptual categories, can be beneficial in fostering learning.\n[273]\nThere has been increasing attention to the development of evidence-based interventions for autistic young children. Three\ntheoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavior analysis (ABA), the\ndevelopmental social-pragmatic model (DSP) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n[271][25] \nAlthough ABA therapy has\na strong evidence base, particularly in regard to early intensive home-based therapy, ABA's effectiveness may be limited by\ndiagnostic severity and IQ of the person affected by ASD.\n[274] \nThe \nJournal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology\nhas published a paper deeming two early childhood interventions \"well-established\": individual comprehensive ABA, and\nfocused teacher-implemented ABA combined with DSP.\n[25]\nMany people, including autistic adults, have criticized ABA, calling it unhelpful, unethical, and even\nabuse.\n[15][275][276][277] \nAutistic scholar Nick Walker, who experienced ABA as a child, has said that, through ABA,\nautistic children are \"abused, coerced, and traumatized into imitating the outward behavior of neurotypical children, at the\nexpense of their long-term psychological well-being.\"\n[15] \nSandoval-Norton et al. also discuss the \"unintended but\ndamaging consequences, such as prompt dependency, psychological abuse and compliance\" that result in autistic people\nfacing challenges as they transition into adulthood.\n[275] \nSome ABA advocates have responded to such critiques that,\ninstead of stopping ABA, there should be movement to increase protections and ethical compliance when working with\nautistic children.\n[278]\nAnother evidence-based intervention that has demonstrated efficacy is a parent training model, which teaches parents how\nto implement various ABA and DSP techniques themselves.\n[25] \nVarious DSP programs have been developed to explicitly\ndeliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation.\nIn October 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposed new evidence-based recommendations for early\ninterventions in ASD for children under 3.\n[279] \nThese recommendations emphasize early involvement with both\ndevelopmental and behavioral methods, support by and for parents and caregivers, and a focus on both the core and\nassociated symptoms of ASD.\n[279] \nBut a Cochrane review found no evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention\n(EIBI) is effective in reducing behavioral problems associated with autism in most autistic children, though it did improve\nIQ and language skills.\n[280] \nThe Cochrane review acknowledged that this may be due to the low quality of studies\navailable on EIBI and therefore providers should recommend EIBI based on their clinical judgment and the family's\npreferences.\n[280] \nNo adverse effects of EIBI treatment were found.\n[280] \nA meta-analysis in that same database indicates that\ndue to the heterology in ASD, children progress to differing early intervention modalities based on ABA.\n[26]\nASD treatment generally focuses on behavioral and educational interventions to target its two core symptoms: social\ncommunication deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors.\n[281] \nIf symptoms continue after behavioral strategies have been\nimplemented, some medications can be recommended to target specific symptoms or co-existing problems such as restricted\nand repetitive behaviors (RRBs), anxiety, depression, hyperactivity/inattention and sleep disturbance.\n[281] \nMelatonin, for\nexample, can be used for sleep problems.\n[282]\nNon-pharmacological interventions\n\nAn autistic three-year-old points to\nfish in an aquarium, as part of an\nexperiment on the effect of intensive\nshared-attention training on language\ndevelopment.\n[284]\nSeveral parent-mediated behavioral therapies target social communication deficits in children with autism, but their efficacy\nin treating RRBs is uncertain.\n[283]\nEducational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis (ABA),\ndevelopmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy and social\nskills therapy.\n[265] \nAmong these approaches, interventions either treat autistic\nfeatures comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit.\n[25]\nThe quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a\ntreatment procedure incorporating over 30 hours per week of the structured type of\nABA that is carried out with very young children—is low; more vigorous research\ndesigns with larger sample sizes are needed.\n[280] \nTwo theoretical frameworks\noutlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA\ninterventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP).\n[25] \nOne\ninterventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how\nto implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to\ndisseminate interventions themselves.\n[25] \nVarious DSP programs have been\ndeveloped to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent\nimplementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these\ninterventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of\ntreatment.\n[25] \nEarly, intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive\nfunctioning in preschool children;\n[265][285] \nit is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age\ngroup.\n[265]\nIn 2018, a Cochrane meta-analysis database concluded that some recent research is beginning to suggest that because of the\nheterology of ASD, there are two different ABA teaching approaches to acquiring spoken language: children with higher\nreceptive language skills respond to 2.5 to 20 hours per week of the naturalistic approach, whereas children with lower\nreceptive language skills require 25 hours per week of discrete trial training—the structured and intensive form of ABA.\n[26]\nA 2023 randomized control trial study of 164 participants showed similar findings.\n[27]\nSimilarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental\nsocial pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children,\nalthough there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms.\n[25] \nNeuropsychological reports are often poorly\ncommunicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.\n[286]\nThe appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education\npopulation is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.\n[287]\nMedications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when\nbehavioral treatment fails.\n[288] \nThey may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD, anxiety, or if the\nperson is hurting themself or aggressive with others,\n[288][289] \nbut their routine prescription for ASD's core features is not\nrecommended.\n[290] \nMore than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed \npsychoactive drugs \nor\nanticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics.\n[291][292] \nThe\natypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-\ninjurious behaviors.\n[270][293] \nBut their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may\nrespond atypically.\n[270] \nSide effects may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression.\n[270] \nSome emerging data\nshow positive effects of aripiprazole and risperidone on restricted and repetitive behaviors (i.e., stimming; e.g., flapping,\ntwisting, complex whole-body movements),\n[290] \nbut due to the small sample size and different focus of these studies and\nthe concerns about its side effects, antipsychotics are not recommended as primary treatment of RRBs.\n[294] \nSSRI\nantidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic\nbehaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with comorbid inattentiveness or\nEducation\nPharmacological interventions\n\nhyperactivity.\n[265] \nThere is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and\nadults with ASD.\n[295] \nNo known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication\nimpairments.\n[270]\nA multitude of alternative therapies have been researched and implemented, and many have resulted in harm to autistic\npeople.\n[272] \nA 2020 systematic review on adults with autism provided evidence that mindfulness-based interventions may\ndecrease stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression and improve mental health.\n[296]\nAlthough popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend\na gluten- and casein-free diet as a standard treatment.\n[297][298][299] \nA 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic\noption for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food\nintolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten-\nand casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet\nwith a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two\nof the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%)\nwas identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed.\n[297] \nThe authors\nconcluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms.\n[297]\nOther problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity\nof the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect.\n[299][300][301] \nIn the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity\nthere is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten-free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.\n[302][303][304]\nThe preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this\nrisk being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D; however,\nsuboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders.\n[305] \nIn\n2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism.\n[306][307] \nChelation is not recommended for autistic\npeople since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits.\n[308] \nAnother alternative medicine practice with no\nevidence is CEASE therapy, a pseudoscientific mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and \"vaccine detoxing\".\n[309]\nResults of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence\nto support mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety,\nruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression.\n[310] \nAn updated Cochrane review (2022) found evidence that music therapy\nlikely improves social interactions, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication skills.\n[311] \nThere has been early\nresearch on hyperbaric treatments in children with autism.\n[312] \nStudies on pet therapy have shown positive effects.\n[313]\nWhile infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism,\n[314] \nvaccination against rubella\ncan prevent many of those cases.\n[315]\nThere is no evidence of a cure for autism.\n[265][144] \nThe degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that\npeople lose their diagnosis of ASD;\n[316][317] \nthis occurs sometimes after intensive treatment\n[318] \nand sometimes not. It is\nnot known how often this outcome happens,\n[319] \nwith reported rates in unselected samples ranging from 3% to\n25%.\n[316][317] \nAlthough core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.\n[149] \nAcquiring\nlanguage before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent\nliving is unlikely in autistic people with higher support needs.\n[320]\nAmong others, academic Temple Grandin has advised against striving to cure autism, saying that if a cure were found, she\nwould choose to stay the way she is. She wrote, \"The skills that people with autism bring to the table should be nurtured\nfor their benefit and [for the benefit of] society\", adding, \"If you totally get rid of autism, you'd have nobody to fix your\nAlternative medicine\nPrevention\nPrognosis\n\nReports of autism cases per 1,000\nchildren rose considerably in the US\nfrom 1996 to 2007. It is unknown\nhow much growth came from\nchanges in rates of autism.\ncomputer in the future\".\n[321][322]\nThe prognosis of autism describes the developmental course, gradual autism development, regressive autism development,\ndifferential outcomes, academic performance and employment.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 1 in 100 children had\nautism during the period from 2012 to 2021 as that was the average estimate in\nstudies published during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over\ntime. However, the study's 1% figure may reflect an underestimate of prevalence in\nlow- and middle-income countries.\n[9][323] \nThe number of people diagnosed has\nincreased considerably since the 1990s, which may be partly due to increased\nrecognition of the condition.\n[324]\nWhile rates of ASD are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly by gender, with\nboys diagnosed far more frequently than girls: 1 in 70 boys, but only 1 in 315 girls\nat eight years of age.\n[325] \nGirls, however, are more likely to have associated\ncognitive impairment, suggesting that less severe forms of ASD are likely being\nmissed in girls and women.\n[326] \nPrevalence differences may be a result of gender\ndifferences in expression of clinical symptoms, with women and girls with autism\nshowing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis.\n[327]\nUsing DSM-5 criteria, 92% of the children diagnosed per DSM-IV with one of the disorders which is considered part of\nASD will still meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD. However, if both ASD and the social (pragmatic) communication\ndisorder categories of DSM-5 are combined, the prevalence of autism is mostly unchanged from the prevalence per the\nDSM-IV criteria. The best estimate for prevalence of ASD is 0.7% or 1 child in 143 children.\n[328] \nRelatively mild forms of\nautism, such as Asperger's as well as other developmental disorders, are included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.\n[329]\nASD rates were constant between 2014 and 2016 but twice the rate compared to the time period between 2011 and 2014\n(1.25 vs 2.47%). A Canadian meta-analysis from 2019 confirmed these effects as the profiles of autistic people became less\nand less different from the profiles of the general population.\n[330] \nIn the US, the rates for diagnosed ASD have been\nsteadily increasing since 2000 when records began being kept.\n[331] \nWhile it remains unclear whether this trend represents a\ntrue rise in incidence, it likely reflects changes in ASD diagnostic criteria, improved detection, and increased public\nawareness of autism.\n[332] \nIn 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and\nover in the UK was 1.1%.\n[333] \nA 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD.\n[334]\nRates of autism are poorly understood in many low- and middle-income countries, which affects the accuracy of global\nASD prevalence estimates,\n[335] \nbut it is thought that most autistic people live in low- and middle-income countries.\n[336]\nIn 2020, the Centers for Disease Control's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network reported\nthat approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States (1 in 34 boys, and 1 in 144 girls) is diagnosed with an autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD), based on data collected in 2016.\n[337][338] \nThis estimate is a 10% increase from the 1 in 59 rate in\n2014, a 105% increase from the 1 in 110 rate in 2006, and a 176% increase from the 1 in 150 rate in 2000.\n[337] \nDiagnostic\ncriteria for ASD have changed significantly since the 1980s; for example, U.S. special-education autism classification was\nintroduced in 1994.\n[183]\nIn the UK, from 1998 to 2018, the autism diagnoses increased by 787%.\n[324] \nThis increase is largely attributable to\nchanges in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public\nawareness\n[339][340][341] \n(particularly among women),\n[324] \nthough unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled\nout.\n[342] \nThe available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased;\n[339] \na real\nincrease would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental\nfactors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.\n[343] \nIt has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism\nand is not a cause of any increase in autism prevalence rates, if any change in the rate of autism exists at all.\n[201]\nEpidemiology\n\nMales have higher likelihood of being diagnosed with ASD than females. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly\nmodified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without.\n[183]\nSeveral theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is\nunconfirmed;\n[344] \none theory is that females are underdiagnosed.\n[345]\nThe risk of developing autism is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the\nknown increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability\nand show some signs of autism.\n[34] \nMost professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not\naffect the occurrence of autism.\n[346]\nAn autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements, that argues autism\nshould be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured,\n[347][348][349][350][351] \nalthough a minority of\nautistic people might still accept a cure.\n[352] \nWorldwide, events related to autism include World Autism Awareness Day,\nAutism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others.\n[353][354][355][356]\nSocial-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural\ncomparisons ... and research on social movements.\"\n[357] \nMany autistic people have been successful in their fields.\n[358]\nSome autistic people, as well as a growing number of researchers,\n[13] \nhave advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view\nthat autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.\n[359][360] \nCritics have\nbemoaned the entrenchment of some of these groups' opinions.\n[361][362][363][364]\nThe neurodiversity movement and the autism rights movement are social movements within the context of disability rights,\nemphasizing the concept of neurodiversity, which describes the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the\nhuman brain rather than a disorder to be cured.\n[349][108] \nThe autism rights movement advocates including greater\nacceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of those without\nautism;\n[365] \nand the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group.\n[365][366]\nAutism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural\nvariation in the \nhuman genome.\n[349] \nThese movements are not without detractors; a common argument against\nneurodiversity activists is that most of them have relatively low support needs, or are self-diagnosed, and do not represent\nthe views of autistic people with higher support needs.\n[366][367][368] \nJacquiline den Houting explores this critique,\ndetermining that the voices of low-support needs autistics are \"some of the most influential within the neurodiversity\nmovement, although admittedly these voices are a minority within the advocacy community\"; she suggests this is in part a\nshortcoming of the wider neurotypical community, referencing non-speaking self-advocate Amy Sequenzia's\nwriting.\n[369][370] \nPier Jaarsma and Stellan Welin make the argument that only high-functioning autistic people should be\nincluded under the neurodiversity banner, as low-functioning autists' condition may rightfully be viewed as a disability.\n[371]\nThe concept of neurodiversity is contentious in autism advocacy and research groups and has led to infighting.\n[372][373]\nHistory\nSociety and culture\nNeurodiversity movement\nEvents\n\nSince 2011, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network has celebrated April as Autism Acceptance Month. In 2021, the Autism\nSociety of America urged organizations to retitle Autism Awareness Day as Autism Acceptance Day, to focus on \"more\nfully integrating those 1 in 54 Americans living with autism into our social fabric\".\n[374]\nOver the years, multiple organizations have tried to capture the essence of autism in symbols. In 1963, the board for the\nNational Autistic Society, led by Gerald Gasson, proposed the \"puzzle piece\" as a symbol for autism, because it fit their\nview of autism as a \"puzzling condition\".\n[375] \nIn 1999, the Autism Society adopted the puzzle ribbon as the universal sign\nof autism awareness.\n[375] \nAs of 2023, the puzzle ribbon has negative associations, such as \"implications of autistic people\nas incomplete and...association with autism hate groups\".\n[374]\nIn 2004, neurodiversity advocates Amy and Gwen Nelson conjured the \"rainbow infinity symbol\". It was initially the logo\nfor their website, Aspies for Freedom. Nowadays, the prismatic colors are often associated with the neurodiversity\nmovement in general.\n[376] \nThe autism spectrum has also been symbolized by the infinity symbol itself.\n[377]\nIn 2018, Julian Morgan wrote the article \"Light It Up Gold\", a response to Autism Speaks's \"Light It Up Blue\" campaign,\nlaunched in 2007.\n[378][379] \nAurum is Latin for gold,\n[376] \nand gold has been used to symbolize autism, since both words\nstart with \"Au\". The flag implements a gradient to represent the Pride Movement and incorporates a golden infinity symbol\nas its focal point.\n[380]\nThe puzzle piece\nsymbol as used in the\nautism awareness\nribbon used by Autism\nSpeaks from 2005\nand now has negative\nassociations\nAutism infinity symbol\nfrom 2013, featuring a\nrainbow gradient from\nleft to right\nGold infinity loop,\nfollowing Julian\nMorgan's 2018 push\nto use gold for autism\nAn autistic pride flag was created in 2005 by Aspies for Freedom for the first Autistic Pride Day, featuring a rainbow\ninfinity symbol on a white background.\n[381]\nAs the rainbow infinity on a white background has become increasingly viewed as representative of neurodiversity in\ngeneral,\n[376] \nseveral designs have been proposed for an autistic-specific flag.\n[382] \nIn 2023, the People's History Museum\nfeatured a 2015 autistic pride design by Joseph Redford, featuring a rainbow infinity symbol, a green background for being\ntrue to one's nature, and a purple background for neurodiversity.\n[383]\nSymbols and flags\nSymbols\nFlags\n\nAn autistic/neurodiversity pride flag\nfeaturing a rainbow infinity, based\non a design from 2013\nThe 2015 autistic pride flag by\nJoseph Redford\nFamilies who care for an autistic child face added stress from a number of different causes.\n[384][385] \nParents may struggle\nto understand the diagnosis and to find appropriate care options. They often take a negative view of the diagnosis, and may\nstruggle emotionally.\n[386] \nMore than half of parents over age 50 are still living with their child, as about 85% of autistic\npeople have difficulties living independently.\n[387] \nSome studies also find decreased earnings among parents who care for\nautistic children.\n[388][389] \nSiblings of children with ASD report greater admiration and less conflict with the affected sibling\nthan siblings of unaffected children, like siblings of children with Down syndrome. But they reported lower levels of\ncloseness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of autistic people have a greater risk of\nnegative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.\n[390]\nOutline of autism\nAnimal model of autism\nAutism and memory\nAutism spectrum disorders in the media\nAutistic art\nControversies in autism\nGlobal perceptions of autism\nList of autistic fictional characters\nList of films about autism\nViolence and autism\nEmployment for people with autism\na.

I live in as an alien in the human world, unable to comprehend their emotional behavior. but with decades of experience, i made models of how to handle different situation. it was a few years ago that I learned when people want to leave the conversation. gradually, rather than asking people who I'm, I started doing my own analysis from unbiased perspective with an insatiable desire to process as much as information as possible and predict the world. I see patterns all the time and I make jokes about them. many times these jokes work. or I say something slightly contradictory but linguistically correct and people brain freeze for a moment to process and then they laugh.\n5. autistic people are people to. I think its a different stable point of human cognition. I can't tell anything other than what I know about myself because I can't know what some else is thinking, I can just try to predict what they are thinking. autistic people are associated with righteousness which I have seen in myself.

Autism is clinically regarded as a spectrum\ndisorder, meaning that it can manifest very differently in each person. For\nexample, some are nonspeaking, while others have proficient spoken language.\nBecause of this, there is wide variation in the support needs of people across the\nautism spectrum.\nPsychiatry has traditionally classified autism as a mental disorder, but the autism\nrights movement (and an increasing number of researchers) see autistic people as\npart of humanity's natural neurodiversity.\n[13][14] \nFrom this point of view, autistic\npeople may also be diagnosed with a disability of some sort, but that disability\nmay be rooted in the systemic structures of a society rather than in the person;\n[15]\nthus, proponents argue that autistic people should be accommodated rather than\ncured.\n[16] \nThe neurodiversity perspective has led to significant controversy\namong those who are autistic and advocates, practitioners, and charities.\n[17][18]\nThere are many theories about the causes of autism; it is highly heritable and\nmainly genetic, but many genes are involved, and environmental factors may also\nbe relevant.\n[19] \nThe syndrome frequently co-occurs with \nattention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Disagreements persist\nabout what should be included as part of the diagnosis, whether there are\nmeaningful subtypes or stages of autism,\n[20] \nand the significance of autism-\nassociated traits in the wider population.\n[21][22] \nThe combination of broader\ncriteria, increased awareness, and the potential increase of actual prevalence, has\nled to a trend of steadily increasing estimates of \nautism prevalence,\n[23]\nunintentionally aiding the disproven myth perpetuated by anti-vaccine activists\nthat it is caused by vaccines.\n[24]\nThere is no cure for autism. Although early intervention services based on applied\nbehavior analysis (ABA) can help children gain self-care, social, and language\nskills,\n[25][26][27][28] \nindependent living is unlikely in more severe forms of the\ncondition. Speech and occupational therapy, as well as augmentative and\nalternative modes of communication, are effective adjunctive therapies, but some\nin the autism rights movement consider ABA therapy unethical and unhelpful.\n[29]\nPharmacological treatments may also be useful; the atypical antipsychotics\n\nRisk factors Family history,\ncertain genetic\nconditions, having\nolder parents,\ncertain prescribed\ndrugs, perinatal\nand neonatal health\nissues\nDiagnostic\nmethod\nBased on\ncombination of\nclinical observation\nof behavior and\ndevelopment and\ncomprehensive\ndiagnostic testing\ncompleted by a\nteam of qualified\nprofessionals\n(including\npsychiatrists,\nclinical\npsychologists,\nneuropsychologists,\npediatricians, and\nspeech-language\npathologists).

This created unclear boundaries between the terms, so for the DSM-5\nand ICD-11, a spectrum approach was taken. The new system is also more\nrestrictive, meaning fewer people qualify for diagnosis.\n[31]\nThe DSM-5 and ICD-11 use different categorization tools to define this spectrum.\nDSM-5 uses a \"level\" system, which ranks how in need of support the patient\nis,\n[32] \nwhile the ICD-11 system has two axes, intellectual impairment and\nlanguage impairment,\n[33] \nas these are seen as the most crucial factors.\nAutism is currently defined as a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder\n[34]\nthat is generally thought to cover a broad and deep spectrum, manifesting very\ndifferently from one person to another. Some have high support needs, may be\nnon-speaking, and experience developmental delays; this is more likely with other\nco-existing diagnoses. Others have relatively low support needs; they may have\nmore typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical\nsocial/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic\ncommunication.\n[35] \nThey may still require significant support in some areas of\ntheir lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running\nfrom mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in\neach person.\n[36] \nHow it presents in a person can depend on context, and may\nvary over time.\n[37]\nWhile the DSM and ICD greatly influence each other, there are also differences.\nFor example, Rett syndrome was included in ASD in the DSM-5, but in the ICD-\n11 it was excluded and placed in the chapter on Developmental Anomalies. The\nICD and the DSM change over time, and there has been collaborative work\ntoward a convergence of the two since 1980 (when DSM-III was published and\nICD-9 was current), including more rigorous biological assessment—in place of\nhistorical experience—and a simplification of the classification\nsystem.\n[38][39][40][41]\nAs of 2023, empirical and theoretical research is leading to a growing consensus\namong researchers that the established ASD criteria are ineffective descriptors of\nautism as a unitary biological entity, and that alternative research approaches must\nbe encouraged, such as going back to autism prototypes, exploring new causal\nmodels of autism, or developing transdiagnostic endophenotypes.\n[42] \nProposed\nalternatives to the current disorder-focused spectrum model deconstruct autism\ninto at least two separate phenomena: (1) a non-pathological spectrum of\nbehavioral traits in the population,\n[43][44] \nand (2) the neuropathological burden of\nClassification\nSpectrum model\n\nbehavior analysis,\ncognitive behavioral\ntherapy,\noccupational\ntherapy,\npsychotropic\nmedication,\n[8]\nspeech–language\npathology\nFrequency \nOne in 100\npeople (1%)\nworldwide\n[9]\nrare genetic mutations and environmental risk factors potentially leading to\nneurodevelopmental and psychological disorders,\n[43][44] \n(3) governed by an\nindividual's cognitive ability to compensate.\n[43]\nThe World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (11th\nRevision), ICD-11, was released in June 2018 and came into full effect as of\nJanuary 2022.\n[45][38] \nIt describes ASD as follows:\n[46]\nAutism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the\nability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social\ncommunication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible\npatterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or\nexcessive for the individual's age and sociocultural context. The onset\nof the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in\nearly childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until\nlater, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are\nsufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social,\neducational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and\nare usually a pervasive feature of the individual's functioning\nobservable in all settings, although they may vary according to social,\neducational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a\nfull range of intellectual functioning and language abilities.\n— ICD-11, chapter 6, section A02\nICD-11 was produced by professionals from 55 countries out of the 90 involved and is the most widely used reference\nworldwide.\nThe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text\nRevision (DSM-5-TR), released in 2022, is the current version of the DSM. It is the predominant mental health diagnostic\nsystem used in the United States and Canada, and is often used in Anglophone countries.\nIts fifth edition, DSM-5, released in May 2013, was the first to define ASD as a single diagnosis,\n[47] \nwhich is still the case\nin the DSM-5-TR.\n[48] \nASD encompasses previous diagnoses, including the four traditional diagnoses of autism—classic\nautism, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise\nspecified (PDD-NOS)—and the range of diagnoses that included the word \"autism\".\n[49] \nRather than distinguishing among\nthese diagnoses, the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR adopt a dimensional approach with one diagnostic category for disorders that\nfall under the autism spectrum umbrella. Within that category, the DSM-5 and the DSM include a framework that\ndifferentiates each person by dimensions of symptom severity, as well as by associated features (i.e., the presence of other\ndisorders or factors that likely contribute to the symptoms, other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders, intellectual\ndisability, or language impairment).\n[48] \nThe symptom domains are (a) social communication and (b) restricted, repetitive\nbehaviors, and there is the option of specifying a separate severity—the negative effect of the symptoms on the person—for\neach domain, rather than just overall severity.\n[50] \nBefore the DSM-5, the DSM separated social deficits and communication\nICD\nDSM\n\ndeficits into two domains.\n[51] \nFurther, the DSM-5 changed to an onset age in the early developmental period, with a note\nthat symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities, rather than the previous, more restricted three\nyears of age.\n[52] \nThese changes remain in the DSM-5-TR.\n[48]\nFor many autistic people, characteristics first appear during infancy or childhood and follow a steady course without\nremission (different developmental timelines are described in more detail below).\n[53] \nAutistic people may be severely\nimpaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others.\n[54][55][56]\nClinicians consider assessment for ASD when a patient shows:\nregular difficulties in social interaction or communication\nrestricted or repetitive behaviors (often called \"stimming\")\nresistance to changes or restricted interests\nThese features are typically assessed with the following, when appropriate:\nproblems in obtaining or sustaining employment or education\ndifficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships\nconnections with mental health or learning disability services\na history of neurodevelopmental conditions (including learning disabilities and ADHD) or mental health\nconditions\n[57][58]\nThere are many signs associated with autism; the presentation varies widely:\n[59][60]\nCommon signs for autism spectrum disorder\nabnormalities in eye contact\nlittle or no babbling as an infant\nnot showing interest in indicated objects\ndelayed language skills (e.g., having a smaller vocabulary than peers or difficulty expressing themselves in words)\nreduced interest in other children or caretakers, possibly with more interest in objects\ndifficulty playing reciprocal games (e.g., peek-a-boo)\nhyper- or hypo-sensitivity to or unusual response to the smell, texture, sound, taste, or appearance of things\nresistance to changes in routine\nrepetitive, limited, or otherwise unusual usage of toys (e.g., lining up toys)\nrepetition of words or phrases (echolalia)\nrepetitive motions or movements, including stimming\nself-harming\nThe broader autism phenotype describes people who may not have ASD but do have autistic traits, such as abnormalities in\neye contact and stimming.\n[61]\nAccording to the medical model, autistic people experience social communications impairments. Until 2013, deficits in\nsocial function and communication were considered two separate symptom domains.\n[62] \nThe current social communication\ndomain criteria for autism diagnosis require people to have deficits across three social skills: social-emotional reciprocity,\nnonverbal communication, and developing and sustaining relationships.\n[48]\nCommon characteristics\nPre-diagnosis\nBroader autism phenotype\nSocial and communication skills\n\nIn 1996, American academic Temple\nGrandin published Emergence: Labeled\nAutistic, describing her life experiences\nas an autistic person.\nA deficit-based view predicts that autistic–autistic interaction would be less\neffective than autistic–non-autistic interactions or even non-functional.\n[63] \nBut\nrecent research has found that autistic–autistic interactions are as effective in\ninformation transfer as interactions between non-autistics are, and that\ncommunication breaks down only between autistics and non-autistics.\n[63][64]\nAlso contrary to social cognitive deficit interpretations, recent (2019) research\nrecorded similar social cognitive performances in autistic and non-autistic adults,\nwith both of them rating autistic individuals less favorably than non-autistic\nindividuals; however, autistic individuals showed more interest in engaging with\nautistic people than non-autistic people did, and learning of a person's ASD\ndiagnosis did not influence their interest level.\n[65]\nThus, there has been a recent shift to acknowledge that autistic people may\nsimply respond and behave differently than people without ASD.\n[66] \nSo far,\nresearch has identified two unconventional features by which autistic people\ncreate shared understanding (intersubjectivity): \"a generous assumption of\ncommon ground that, when understood, led to rapid rapport, and, when not\nunderstood, resulted in potentially disruptive utterances; and a low demand for coordination that ameliorated many\nchallenges associated with disruptive turns.\"\n[64] \nAutistic interests, and thus conversational topics, seem to be largely driven\nby an intense interest in specific topics (monotropism).\n[67][68]\nHistorically, autistic children were said to be delayed in developing a theory of mind, and the empathizing–systemizing\ntheory has argued that while autistic people have compassion (affective empathy) for others with similar presentation of\nsymptoms, they have limited, though not necessarily absent, cognitive empathy.\n[69] \nThis may present as social naïvety,\n[70]\nlower than average intuitive perception of the utility or meaning of body language, social reciprocity,\n[71] \nand/or social\nexpectations, including the habitus, social cues, and/or some aspects of sarcasm,\n[72] \nwhich to some degree may also be due\nto comorbid alexithymia.\n[73] \nBut recent research has increasingly questioned these findings, as the \"double empathy\nproblem\" theory (2012) argues that there is a lack of mutual understanding and empathy between both non-autistic persons\nand autistic individuals.\n[74][75][76][77][78]\nAs communication is bidirectional,\n[79] \nresearch on communication difficulties has since also begun to study non-autistic\nbehavior, with researcher Catherine Crompton writing in 2020 that non-autistic people \"struggle to identify autistic mental\nstates, identify autistic facial expressions, overestimate autistic egocentricity, and are less willing to socially interact with\nautistic people. Thus, although non-autistic people are generally characterised as socially skilled, these skills may not be\nfunctional, or effectively applied, when interacting with autistic people.\"\n[63] \nAny previously observed communication\ndeficits of autistic people may thus have been constructed through a neurotypical bias in autism research, which has come\nto be scrutinized for \"dehumanization, objectification, and stigmatization\".\n[80] \nRecent research has proposed that autistics'\nlack of readability and a neurotypical lack of effort to interpret atypical signals may cause a negative interaction loop,\nincreasingly driving both groups apart into two distinct groups with different social interaction styles.\n[79]\nDifferences in verbal communication begin to be noticeable in childhood, as many autistic children develop language skills\nat an uneven pace. Verbal communication may be delayed or never develop (nonverbal autism), while reading ability may\nbe present before school age (hyperlexia).\n[81][82] \nReduced joint attention seem to distinguish autistic from non-autistic\ninfants.\n[83] \nInfants may show delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns\nthat are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children may have less frequent and less\ndiverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic\nchildren are less likely to make requests or share experiences and more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia).\n[84]\nThe CDC estimated in 2015 that around 40% of autistic children do not speak at all.\n[85] \nAutistic adults' verbal\ncommunication skills largely depend on when and how well speech is acquired during childhood.\n[81]\nAutistic people display atypical nonverbal behaviors or show differences in nonverbal communication. They may make\ninfrequent eye contact, even when called by name, or avoid it altogether. This may be due to the high amount of sensory\ninput received when making eye contact.\n[86] \nAutistic people often recognize fewer emotions and their meaning from others'\nfacial expressions, and may not respond with facial expressions expected by their non-autistic peers.\n[87][82] \nTemple\n\nA young autistic boy who has\narranged his toys in a row\nAn older autistic boy arranging brads\non a cork coaster\nGrandin, an autistic woman involved in autism activism, described her inability to understand neurotypicals' social\ncommunication as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".\n[88] \nAutistic people struggle to understand the social\ncontext and subtext of neurotypical conversational or printed situations, and form different conclusions about the\ncontent.\n[89] \nAutistic people may not control the volume of their voice in different social settings.\n[90] \nAt least half of autistic\nchildren have atypical prosody.\n[90]\nWhat may look like self-involvement or indifference to non-autistic people stems from autistic differences in recognizing\nhow other people have their own personalities, perspectives, and interests.\n[89][91] \nMost published research focuses on the\ninterpersonal relationship difficulties between autistic people and their non-autistic counterparts and how to solve them\nthrough teaching neurotypical social skills, but newer research has also evaluated what autistic people want from\nfriendships, such as a sense of belonging and good mental health.\n[92][93] \nChildren with ASD are more frequently involved\nin bullying situations than their non-autistic peers, and predominantly experience bullying as victims rather than perpetrators\nor victim-perpetrators, especially after controlling for comorbid psychopathology.\n[94] \nPrioritizing dependability and\nintimacy in friendships during adolescence, coupled with lowered friendship quantity and quality, often lead to increased\nloneliness in autistic people.\n[95] \nAs they progress through life, autistic people observe and form a model of social patterns,\nand develop coping mechanisms, referred to as \"masking\",\n[96][97] \nwhich have recently been found to come with\npsychological costs and a higher increased risk of suicidality.\n[79]\nASD includes a wide variety of characteristics. Some of these include behavioral\ncharacteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning\nskills to difficulties creating connections with other people. Autistic people may\nexperience these challenges with forming connections due to anxiety or depression,\nwhich they are more likely to experience, and as a result isolate themselves.\n[98][99]\nOther behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations (such as\nsights, sounds, touch, taste and smell) and problems keeping a consistent speech\nrhythm. The latter problem influences social skills, leading to potential problems in\nunderstanding for interlocutors. Autistic people's behavioral characteristics typically\ninfluence development, language, and social competence. Their behavioral\ncharacteristics can be observed as perceptual disturbances, disturbances of\ndevelopment rate, relating, speech and language, and motility.\n[100]\nThe second core symptom of autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests. In\norder to be diagnosed with ASD under the DSM-5-TR, a person must have at least two of the following behaviors:\n[48][101]\nRepetitive behaviors – Repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand\nflapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or\nsounds.\n[102] \nThese behaviors may occur constantly or only when the\nperson gets stressed, anxious, or upset. These behaviors are also\nknown as stimming.\nResistance to change – A strict adherence to routines such as eating\ncertain foods in a specific order or taking the same path to school every\nday.\n[102] \nThe person may become distressed if there is a change or\ndisruption to their routine.\nRestricted interests – An excessive interest in a particular activity, topic,\nor hobby, and devoting all their attention to it. For example, young\nchildren might completely focus on things that spin and ignore\neverything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a\nsingle topic, such as the weather or sports, and perseverate or talk about it constantly.\n[102]\nSensory reactivity – An unusual reaction to certain sensory inputs, such as negative reaction to specific\nsounds or textures, fascination with lights or movements, or apparent indifference to pain or heat.\n[103]\nAutistic people can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised\n(RBS-R) categorizes as follows.\n[104]\nRestricted and repetitive behaviors\n\nIn 2021, screenwriter and actor\nWentworth Miller revealed his autism\ndiagnosis in a now-deleted Instagram\npost, stating it was \"a shock\" but\n\"not a surprise\".\n[113]\nStereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.\nCompulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety, that a person feels\ncompelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order,\nchecking things, or handwashing.\nSameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be\ninterrupted.\nRitualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual.\nThis is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the\ntwo factors.\n[104]\nSelf-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging.\n[83]\nSelf-injurious behaviors are relatively common in autistic people, and can include head-banging, self-cutting, self-biting,\nand hair-pulling.\n[105] \nSome of these can result in serious injury or death.\n[105] \nFollowing are theories about the cause of self-\ninjurious behavior in children with developmental delay, including autistic children:\n[106]\nFrequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g.\nreward in return for halting self-injurious behavior). This theory does not apply to younger children with\nautism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or\nmodifying environmental factors that reinforce the behavior.\n[106]: 10–12\nHigher rates of self-injury are also noted in socially isolated autistic people. Studies have shown that\nsocialization skills are related factors to self-injurious behavior for autistic people.\n[107]\nSelf-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems\nthat cause pain are present.\n[106]: 12–13\nAn abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior.\n[106]: 13\nThe suicide rate for verbal autistics is nine times that of the general population.\n[108]\nStudies have supported the common belief that autistic people become exhausted or burnt out in some\nsituations.\n[109][110][111][112]\nAutistic people may have symptoms that do not contribute to the official diagnosis,\nbut that can affect the person or the family.\n[114]\nSome autistic people show unusual or notable abilities, ranging from\nsplinter skills (such as the memorization of trivia) to rare talents in\nmathematics, music, or artistic reproduction, which in exceptional\ncases are considered a part of the savant syndrome.\n[115][116][117] \nOne\nstudy describes how some autistic people show superior skills in\nperception and attention relative to the general population.\n[118]\nSensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of autistic people, and\nare considered core features by some.\n[119]\nMore generally, autistic people tend to show a \"spiky skills profile\", with\nstrong abilities in some areas contrasting with much weaker abilities in\nothers.\n[120]\nDifferences between the previously recognized disorders under the autism spectrum are greater for under-\nresponsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud\nnoises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).\n[121] \nAn estimated 60–80% of autistic\npeople have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking;\n[119][122]\ndeficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.\n[123][124]\nPathological demand avoidance can occur. People with this set of autistic symptoms are more likely to\nrefuse to do what is asked or expected of them, even to activities they enjoy.\nSelf-injury\nBurnout\nOther features\n\nUnusual or atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it\nwas formerly a diagnostic indicator.\n[114] \nSelectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals\nand food refusal also occur.\n[125]\nIn September 2018, the Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders published a systematic review of 47\nstudies published from 2005 to 2016 that concluded that associations between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and screen\ntime was inconclusive.\n[126] \nIn May 2019, the \nJournal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics \npublished a systematic\nreview of 16 studies that found that children and adolescents with ASD are exposed to more screen time than typically\ndeveloping peers and that the exposure starts at a younger age.\n[127] \nIn April 2021, \nResearch in Autism Spectrum Disorders\npublished a systematic review of 12 studies of video game addiction in ASD subjects that found that children, adolescents,\nand adults with ASD are at greater risk of video game addiction than those without ASD, and that the data from the studies\nsuggested that internal and external factors (sex, attention and oppositional behavior problems, social aspects, access and\ntime spent playing video games, parental rules, and game genre) were significant predictors of video game addiction in\nASD subjects.\n[128] \nIn March 2022, the Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders published a systematic\nreview of 21 studies investigating associations between ASD, problematic internet use, and gaming disorder where the\nmajority of the studies found positive associations between the disorders.\n[129]\nIn August 2022, the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction published a review of 15 studies that found that\nhigh rates of video game use in boys and young males with ASD was predominantly explained by video game addiction,\nbut also concluded that greater video game use could be a function of ASD restricted interest and that video game addiction\nand ASD restricted interest could have an interactive relationship.\n[130] \nIn December 2022, the Review Journal of Autism\nand Developmental Disorders published a systematic review of 10 studies researching the prevalence of problematic\ninternet use with ASD that found that ASD subjects had more symptoms of problematic internet use than control group\nsubjects, had higher screen time online and an earlier age of first-time use of the internet, and also greater symptoms of\ndepression and ADHD.\n[131] \nIn July 2023, \nCureus \npublished a systematic review of 11 studies that concluded that earlier\nand longer screen time exposure for children was associated with higher risk of a child developing ASD.\n[132] \nIn December\n2023, JAMA Network Open published a meta-analysis of 46 studies comprising 562,131 subjects that concluded that while\nscreen time may pose a developmental risk of ASD in childhood, associations between ASD and screen time were not\nstatistically significant when accounting for publication bias.\n[133]\nExactly what causes autism remains unknown.\n[134][135][136][137] \nIt was long mostly presumed that there is a common\ncause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for the social and non-social components of ASD's symptoms, described\nas a triad in the classic autism criteria.\n[138] \nBut it is increasingly suspected that autism is instead a complex disorder whose\ncore aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur.\n[138][139] \nIt is unlikely that ASD has a single cause;\n[139] \nmany risk\nfactors identified in the research literature may contribute to ASD. These include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors\n(meaning factors during pregnancy or very early infancy), neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is\npossible to identify general factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific ones. Given the current state of knowledge,\nprediction can only be of a global nature and so requires the use of general markers.\n[140]\nResearch into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic\npopulation\n[141] \nand by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and\npediatrics.\n[142] \nNewer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant\nphenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism;\n[143] \none\nexample is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people\nversus objects.\n[144] \nIt has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.\n[145]\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be classified into two categories: \"syndromic autism\" and \"non-syndromic autism\".\nProblematic digital media use\nPossible causes\nBiological subgroups\nSyndromic autism and non-syndromic autism\n\nHundreds of different genes are implicated in susceptibility\nto developing autism,\n[146] \nmost of which alter the brain\nstructure in a similar way.\nSyndromic autism refers to cases where ASD is one of the characteristics associated with a broader medical condition or\nsyndrome, representing about 25% of ASD cases. The causes of syndromic autism are often known, and monogenic\ndisorders account for approximately 5% of these cases.\nNon-syndromic autism, also known as classic or idiopathic autism, represents the majority of cases, and its cause is\ntypically polygenic and unknown.\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of\nautism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained\nmore by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multi-\ngene interactions of common genetic variants.\n[147][148]\nComplexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes,\nthe environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change\nDNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene\nexpression.\n[149] \nMany genes have been associated with autism\nthrough sequencing the genomes of affected people and their\nparents.\n[150] \nBut most of the mutations that increase autism\nrisk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be\ntraced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single\nchromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASD have been shown to selectively cause\nASD.\n[147] \nNumerous genes have been found, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.\n[147] \nMost loci\nindividually explain less than 1% of cases of autism.\n[151] \nAs of 2018, it appeared that between 74% and 93% of ASD risk\nis heritable.\n[101] \nAfter an older child is diagnosed with ASD, 7% to 20% of subsequent children are likely to be as\nwell.\n[101] \nIf parents have one autistic child, they have a 2% to 8% chance of having a second child who is autistic. If the\nautistic child is an identical twin, the other will be affected 36% to 95% of the time. A fraternal twin is affected up to 31%\nof the time. The large number of autistic people with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural\nvariation, such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis.\n[152][153] \nHence, a substantial\nfraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation\nthat causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.\n[154]\nAs of 2018, understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles to an understanding that genetic\ninvolvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a\nsmall effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare\nvariants appeared to be CHD8, but less than 0.5% of autistic people have such a mutation. The gene CHD8 encodes the\nprotein chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8, which is a chromatin regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal\ndevelopment. CHD8 is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent enzyme.\n[155][156][157] \nThe protein contains an Snf2\nhelicase domain that is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\n[157] \nCHD8 encodes a DNA\nhelicase that functions as a repressor of transcription, remodeling chromatin structure by altering the position of\nnucleosomes. CHD8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is important in the vertebrate early development\nand morphogenesis. It is believed that CHD8 also recruits the linker histone H1 and causes the repression of β-catenin and\np53 target genes.\n[155] \nThe importance of CHD8 can be observed in studies where CHD8-knockout mice died after 5.5\nembryonic days because of widespread p53-induced apoptosis. Some studies have determined the role of CHD8 in autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD). CHD8 expression significantly increases during human mid-fetal development.\n[155] \nThe\nchromatin remodeling activity and its interaction with transcriptional regulators have shown to play an important role in\nASD aetiology.\n[156] \nThe developing mammalian brain has conserved CHD8 target regions that are associated with ASD\nrisk genes.\n[158] \nThe knockdown of CHD8 in human neural stem cells results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes that are\ntargeted by CHD8.\n[159] \nRecently CHD8 has been associated with the regulation of \nlong non-coding RNAs\n(lncRNAs),\n[160] \nand the regulation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiation, via regulation of Xist long non-coding\nRNA, the master regulator of XCI, though competitive binding to Xist regulatory regions.\n[161]\nGenetics\n\nSome ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like fragile X syndrome, but only around 2% of autistic people\nhave fragile X.\n[101] \nHypotheses from evolutionary psychiatry suggest that these genes persist because they are linked to\nhuman inventiveness, intelligence or systemising.\n[162][163]\nCurrent research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal\ncells in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, synapse formation and remodeling, and excitatory to\ninhibitory neurotransmitter balance. Therefore, although up to 1,000 different genes are thought to increase the risk of\nASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the\nbrain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain. Some of these genes are known to modulate production of\nthe GABA neurotransmitter, the nervous system's main inhibitory neurotransmitter. These GABA-related genes are under-\nexpressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand, genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain, e.g.\nastrocytes and microglia, respectively, are over-expressed, which correlates with increased number of glial and immune\ncells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the\nmTOR signaling pathway, which supports cell growth and survival.\n[164]\nAll these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autism spectrum, but it cannot be guaranteed that they are\ndeterminants for the development.\n[165]\nASD may be under-diagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition,\n[166] \nbut\ngenetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in\nmales, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted\nbrain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory.\n[167][168][169]\nSeveral prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism. These risk factors\ninclude maternal gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal age over 30,\n[170][171][172] \nbleeding during pregnancy after the\nfirst trimester, use of certain prescription medication (e.g. valproate) during pregnancy, and meconium in the amniotic fluid.\nResearch is not conclusive on the relation of these factors to autism, but each of them has been identified more frequently in\nchildren with autism compared to their siblings who do not have autism and other typically developing youth.\n[173] \nWhile it\nis unclear if any single factors during the prenatal phase affect the risk of autism,\n[174] \ncomplications during pregnancy may\nbe a risk.\n[174]\nThere are also studies being done to test whether certain types of regressive autism have an autoimmune basis.\n[175]\nMaternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine\ngrowth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants.\n[176] \nMaternal inflammatory and autoimmune\ndiseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.\n[177] \nSystematic reviews\nand meta-analyses have found that maternal prenatal infections, prenatal antibiotic exposure, and post-term pregnancies are\nassociated with increased risk of ASD in children.\n[178][179][180]\nExposure to air pollution during child pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of\nautism.\n[181][182] \nEnvironmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism\ninclude certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides,\nbrominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines,\n[183] \nand prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR\nvaccine, have been completely disproven.\n[184][185][186][187]\nParents may first become aware of ASD symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to\nunsupported and disproven theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", the vaccine preservative thiomersal, or the MMR vaccine\nfor causing autism spectrum disorder.\n[188] \nIn 1998, British physician and academic Andrew Wakefield led a fraudulent,\nlitigation-funded study that suggested that the MMR vaccine may cause autism.\n[189][190][191][192][193]\nEarly life\nDisproven vaccine hypothesis\n\nTwo versions of the vaccine causation hypothesis were that autism results from brain damage caused by either the MMR\nvaccine itself, or by mercury used as a vaccine preservative.\n[194] \nNo convincing scientific evidence supports these\nclaims.\n[24] \nThey are biologically implausible,\n[188] \nand further evidence continues to refute them, including the observation\nthat the rate of autism continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from most routine vaccines given to children\nfrom birth to 6 years of age.\n[195][196][197][198][199]\nA 2014 meta-analysis examined ten major studies on autism and vaccines involving 1.25 million children worldwide; it\nconcluded that neither the vaccine preservative thimerosal (mercury), nor the MMR vaccine, which has never contained\nthimerosal,\n[200] \nlead to the development of ASDs.\n[201] \nDespite this, misplaced parental concern has led to lower rates of\nchildhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable\ndeaths of several children.\n[202][203]\nSeveral hypotheses have been presented that try to explain how and why autism develops by integrating known causes\n(genetic and environmental effects) and findings (neurobiological and somatic). Some are more comprehensive, such as the\nPathogenetic Triad, which proposes and operationalizes three core features (an autistic personality, cognitive compensation,\nneuropathological burden) that interact to cause autism,\n[204] \nand the Intense World Theory, which explains autism through\na hyper-active neurobiology that leads to an increased perception, attention, memory, and emotionality.\n[205] \nThere are also\nsimpler hypotheses that explain only individual parts of the neurobiology or phenotype of autism, such as mind-blindness (a\ndecreased ability for theory of mind), the weak central coherence theory, or the extreme male brain and empathising–\nsystemising theory.\nResearch exploring the evolutionary benefits of autism and associated genes has suggested that autistic people may have\nplayed a \"unique role in technological spheres and understanding of natural systems\" in the course of human\ndevelopment.\n[206][207] \nIt has been suggested that autism may have arisen as \"a slight trade off for other traits that are seen\nas highly advantageous\", providing \"advantages in tool making and mechanical thinking\", with speculation that the\ncondition may \"reveal itself to be the result of a balanced polymorphism, like sickle cell anemia, that is advantageous in a\ncertain mixture of genes and disadvantageous in specific combinations\".\n[208] \nIn 2011, a paper in \nEvolutionary Psychology\nproposed that autistic traits, including increased spatial intelligence, concentration and memory, could have been naturally\nselected to enable self-sufficient foraging in a more (although not completely) solitary environment. This is called the\n\"Solitary Forager Hypothesis\".\n[209][210][211] \nA 2016 paper examines Asperger syndrome as \"an alternative prosocial\nadaptive strategy\" that may have developed as a result of the emergence of \"collaborative morality\" in the context of small-\nscale hunter-gathering, i.e., where \"a positive social reputation for making a contribution to group wellbeing and survival\"\nbecomes more important than complex social understanding.\n[212]\nSome multidisciplinary research suggests that recent human evolution may be a driving force in the rise of a number of\nmedical conditions, including autism, in recent human populations. Studies in evolutionary medicine indicate that as\ncultural evolution outpaces biological evolution, disorders linked to bodily dysfunction increase in prevalence due to lack of\ncontact with pathogens and negative environmental conditions that once widely affected ancestral populations. Because\nnatural selection favors reproduction over health and longevity, the lack of this impetus to adapt to certain harmful\ncircumstances creates a tendency for genes in descendant populations to over-express themselves, which may cause a wide\narray of maladies, ranging from mental disorders to autoimmune diseases.\n[213] \nConversely, noting the failure to find\nspecific alleles that reliably cause autism or rare mutations that account for more than 5% of the heritable variation in autism\nestablished by twin and adoption studies, research in evolutionary psychiatry has concluded that it is unlikely that there is\nselection pressure for autism when considering that, like schizophrenics, autistic people and their siblings tend to have\nEtiological hypotheses\nEvolutionary hypotheses\n\nEuler diagram showing overlapping\nclinical phenotypes in genes\nassociated with monogenic forms of\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD),\ndystonia, epilepsy and\nschizophrenia:\nGenes associated with epilepsy\nGenes associated with\nschizophrenia\nGenes associated with autism\nspectrum disorder\nGenes associated with dystonia\nfewer offspring on average than non-autistic people, and instead that autism is probably better explained as a by-product of\nadaptive traits caused by antagonistic pleiotropy and by genes that are retained due to a fitness landscape with an\nasymmetric distribution.\n[214][215]\nAutism is correlated or comorbid with several personality traits/disorders.\n[144]\nComorbidity may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with\nASDs and make intervention and treatment more difficult. Distinguishing between\nASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often\noverlap with symptoms of other disorders, and the characteristics of ASDs make\ntraditional diagnostic procedures difficult.\n[216][217]\nResearch indicates that autistic people are significantly more likely to be LGBT\nthan the general population.\n[218] \nThere is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria\noccurs more frequently in autistic people.\n[219][220] \nA 2021 anonymized online\nsurvey of 16- to 90-year-olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to identify\nas bisexual than their non-autistic peers, while autistic females are more likely to\nidentify as homosexual than non-autistic females do.\n[221]\nPeople on the autism spectrum are significantly more likely to be non-theistic than\nmembers of the general population.\n[222]\nThe most common medical condition occurring in autistic people is\nseizure disorder or epilepsy, which occurs in 11–39% of autistic people.\n[223] \nThe risk varies with age,\ncognitive level, and type of language disorder.\n[224]\nTuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant genetic condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the\nbrain and on other vital organs, is present in 1–4% of autistic people.\n[225]\nIntellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. As diagnosis is\nincreasingly being given to people with higher functioning autism, there is a tendency for the proportion\nwith comorbid intellectual disability to decrease over time. In a 2019 study, it was estimated that\napproximately 30–40% of people diagnosed with ASD also have intellectual disability.\n[226] \nRecent\nresearch has suggested that autistic people with intellectual disability tend to have rarer, more harmful,\ngenetic mutations than those found in people solely diagnosed with autism.\n[227] \nA number of genetic\nsyndromes causing intellectual disability may also be comorbid with ASD, including fragile X, Down,\nPrader-Willi, Angelman, Williams syndrome,\n[228] \nbranched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase\ndeficiency,\n[229][230] \nand SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability.\n[231][232]\nLearning disabilities are also highly comorbid in people with an ASD. Approximately 25–75% of people\nwith an ASD also have some degree of a learning disability.\n[233] \nIn particular, attention deficit disorder,\nwhich is generally more prevalent than autism (ca. 8% vs. 1%), is not directly related, though it is\nsometimes comorbid with autism.\n[234]\nVarious anxiety disorders tend to co-occur with ASDs, with overall comorbidity rates of 7–84%.\n[235] \nThey\nare common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences\nPathophysiology\nDiagnosis\nConditions correlated or comorbid to autism\nCorrelations\nComorbidities\n\nranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself\nor are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.\n[236]\nRates of comorbid depression in people with an ASD range from 4–58%.\n[237]\nThe relationship between ASD and schizophrenia remains a controversial subject under continued\ninvestigation, and recent meta-analyses have examined genetic, environmental, infectious, and immune\nrisk factors that may be shared between the two conditions.\n[238][239][240] \nOxidative stress, DNA damage\nand DNA repair have been postulated to play a role in the aetiopathology of both ASD and\nschizophrenia.\n[241]\nDeficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following directions, being\ncooperative, and doing things on other people's terms.\n[242] \nSymptoms similar to those of attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be part of an ASD diagnosis.\n[243]\nSensory processing disorder is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42–88%.\n[244]\nStarting in adolescence, some people with Asperger syndrome (26% in one sample)\n[245] \nfall under the\ncriteria for the similar condition schizoid personality disorder, which is characterized by a lack of interest in\nsocial relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional\ncoldness, detachment and apathy.\n[245][246][247] \nAsperger syndrome was traditionally called \"schizoid\ndisorder of childhood\".\nGenetic disorders – about 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene)\ncondition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndromes.\n[248]\nSeveral metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.\n[249]\nGastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co-occurring medical conditions in autistic\npeople.\n[250] \nThese are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, language impairments, mood\nchanges, and behavior and sleep problems.\n[250][251][252] \nA 2015 review proposed that immune,\ngastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food\nmetabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction.\n[251] \nA 2016 review concludes that enteric\nnervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural\nconnections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to\nspread to the brain.\n[252]\nSleep problems affect about two-thirds of autistic people at some point in childhood. These most\ncommonly include symptoms of insomnia, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings,\nand early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress,\nand are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.\n[253]\nDysautonomia is common in ASD, affecting heart rate and blood pressure and causing symptoms such as\nbrain fog, blurry vision, and bowel dysfunction.\n[254] \nIt can be diagnosed through a Tilt table test.\n[255]\nThe frequency of ASD is 10 times higher in Mast cell activation syndrome patients than in the general\npopulation. This immunological condition causes cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal,\nneurological, and respiratory problems.\n[256]\nThere is no treatment as such for autism,\n[257] \nand many sources advise that this is not an appropriate goal,\n[258][259]\nalthough treatment of co-occurring conditions remains an important goal.\n[260] \nThere is no cure for autism as of 2024, nor\ncan any of the known treatments significantly reduce brain mutations caused by autism, although those who require little to\nno support are more likely to experience a lessening of symptoms over time.\n[261][262][263] \nSeveral interventions can help\nchildren with autism,\n[264] \nand no single treatment is best, with treatment typically tailored to the child's needs.\n[265] \nStudies\nof interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy,\n[266] \nbut the development\nof evidence-based interventions has advanced.\n[25]\nThe main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and\nfunctional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved\ntreatment outcomes.\n[267][25] \nBehavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist\nautistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently,\n[268] \nas well as other social, communication, and\nlanguage skills. Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths.\n[269]\nManagement\n\nIntensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children acquire self-care,\nlanguage, and job skills.\n[265] \nAlthough evidence-based interventions for autistic children vary in their methods, many adopt\na psychoeducational approach to enhancing cognitive, communication, and social skills while minimizing problem\nbehaviors. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms,\nsuch as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.\n[270]\nIntensive, sustained special education or remedial education programs and behavior therapy early in life may help children\nacquire self-care, social, and job skills. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis, developmental models,\nstructured teaching, speech and language therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy,\n[271] \nsocial skills therapy, and occupational\ntherapy.\n[272] \nAmong these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focus treatment on a\nspecific area of deficit.\n[25] \nGenerally, when educating those with autism, specific tactics may be used to effectively relay\ninformation to these people. Using as much social interaction as possible is key in targeting the inhibition autistic people\nexperience concerning person-to-person contact. Additionally, research has shown that employing semantic groupings,\nwhich involves assigning words to typical conceptual categories, can be beneficial in fostering learning.\n[273]\nThere has been increasing attention to the development of evidence-based interventions for autistic young children. Three\ntheoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavior analysis (ABA), the\ndevelopmental social-pragmatic model (DSP) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n[271][25] \nAlthough ABA therapy has\na strong evidence base, particularly in regard to early intensive home-based therapy, ABA's effectiveness may be limited by\ndiagnostic severity and IQ of the person affected by ASD.\n[274] \nThe \nJournal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology\nhas published a paper deeming two early childhood interventions \"well-established\": individual comprehensive ABA, and\nfocused teacher-implemented ABA combined with DSP.\n[25]\nMany people, including autistic adults, have criticized ABA, calling it unhelpful, unethical, and even\nabuse.\n[15][275][276][277] \nAutistic scholar Nick Walker, who experienced ABA as a child, has said that, through ABA,\nautistic children are \"abused, coerced, and traumatized into imitating the outward behavior of neurotypical children, at the\nexpense of their long-term psychological well-being.\"\n[15] \nSandoval-Norton et al. also discuss the \"unintended but\ndamaging consequences, such as prompt dependency, psychological abuse and compliance\" that result in autistic people\nfacing challenges as they transition into adulthood.\n[275] \nSome ABA advocates have responded to such critiques that,\ninstead of stopping ABA, there should be movement to increase protections and ethical compliance when working with\nautistic children.\n[278]\nAnother evidence-based intervention that has demonstrated efficacy is a parent training model, which teaches parents how\nto implement various ABA and DSP techniques themselves.\n[25] \nVarious DSP programs have been developed to explicitly\ndeliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation.\nIn October 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) proposed new evidence-based recommendations for early\ninterventions in ASD for children under 3.\n[279] \nThese recommendations emphasize early involvement with both\ndevelopmental and behavioral methods, support by and for parents and caregivers, and a focus on both the core and\nassociated symptoms of ASD.\n[279] \nBut a Cochrane review found no evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention\n(EIBI) is effective in reducing behavioral problems associated with autism in most autistic children, though it did improve\nIQ and language skills.\n[280] \nThe Cochrane review acknowledged that this may be due to the low quality of studies\navailable on EIBI and therefore providers should recommend EIBI based on their clinical judgment and the family's\npreferences.\n[280] \nNo adverse effects of EIBI treatment were found.\n[280] \nA meta-analysis in that same database indicates that\ndue to the heterology in ASD, children progress to differing early intervention modalities based on ABA.\n[26]\nASD treatment generally focuses on behavioral and educational interventions to target its two core symptoms: social\ncommunication deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors.\n[281] \nIf symptoms continue after behavioral strategies have been\nimplemented, some medications can be recommended to target specific symptoms or co-existing problems such as restricted\nand repetitive behaviors (RRBs), anxiety, depression, hyperactivity/inattention and sleep disturbance.\n[281] \nMelatonin, for\nexample, can be used for sleep problems.\n[282]\nNon-pharmacological interventions\n\nAn autistic three-year-old points to\nfish in an aquarium, as part of an\nexperiment on the effect of intensive\nshared-attention training on language\ndevelopment.\n[284]\nSeveral parent-mediated behavioral therapies target social communication deficits in children with autism, but their efficacy\nin treating RRBs is uncertain.\n[283]\nEducational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis (ABA),\ndevelopmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy and social\nskills therapy.\n[265] \nAmong these approaches, interventions either treat autistic\nfeatures comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit.\n[25]\nThe quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a\ntreatment procedure incorporating over 30 hours per week of the structured type of\nABA that is carried out with very young children—is low; more vigorous research\ndesigns with larger sample sizes are needed.\n[280] \nTwo theoretical frameworks\noutlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA\ninterventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP).\n[25] \nOne\ninterventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how\nto implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to\ndisseminate interventions themselves.\n[25] \nVarious DSP programs have been\ndeveloped to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent\nimplementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these\ninterventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of\ntreatment.\n[25] \nEarly, intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive\nfunctioning in preschool children;\n[265][285] \nit is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age\ngroup.\n[265]\nIn 2018, a Cochrane meta-analysis database concluded that some recent research is beginning to suggest that because of the\nheterology of ASD, there are two different ABA teaching approaches to acquiring spoken language: children with higher\nreceptive language skills respond to 2.5 to 20 hours per week of the naturalistic approach, whereas children with lower\nreceptive language skills require 25 hours per week of discrete trial training—the structured and intensive form of ABA.\n[26]\nA 2023 randomized control trial study of 164 participants showed similar findings.\n[27]\nSimilarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental\nsocial pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children,\nalthough there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms.\n[25] \nNeuropsychological reports are often poorly\ncommunicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.\n[286]\nThe appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education\npopulation is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.\n[287]\nMedications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when\nbehavioral treatment fails.\n[288] \nThey may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD, anxiety, or if the\nperson is hurting themself or aggressive with others,\n[288][289] \nbut their routine prescription for ASD's core features is not\nrecommended.\n[290] \nMore than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed \npsychoactive drugs \nor\nanticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics.\n[291][292] \nThe\natypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-\ninjurious behaviors.\n[270][293] \nBut their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may\nrespond atypically.\n[270] \nSide effects may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression.\n[270] \nSome emerging data\nshow positive effects of aripiprazole and risperidone on restricted and repetitive behaviors (i.e., stimming; e.g., flapping,\ntwisting, complex whole-body movements),\n[290] \nbut due to the small sample size and different focus of these studies and\nthe concerns about its side effects, antipsychotics are not recommended as primary treatment of RRBs.\n[294] \nSSRI\nantidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic\nbehaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with comorbid inattentiveness or\nEducation\nPharmacological interventions\n\nhyperactivity.\n[265] \nThere is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and\nadults with ASD.\n[295] \nNo known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication\nimpairments.\n[270]\nA multitude of alternative therapies have been researched and implemented, and many have resulted in harm to autistic\npeople.\n[272] \nA 2020 systematic review on adults with autism provided evidence that mindfulness-based interventions may\ndecrease stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression and improve mental health.\n[296]\nAlthough popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend\na gluten- and casein-free diet as a standard treatment.\n[297][298][299] \nA 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic\noption for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food\nintolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten-\nand casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet\nwith a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two\nof the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%)\nwas identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed.\n[297] \nThe authors\nconcluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms.\n[297]\nOther problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity\nof the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect.\n[299][300][301] \nIn the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity\nthere is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten-free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.\n[302][303][304]\nThe preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this\nrisk being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D; however,\nsuboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders.\n[305] \nIn\n2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism.\n[306][307] \nChelation is not recommended for autistic\npeople since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits.\n[308] \nAnother alternative medicine practice with no\nevidence is CEASE therapy, a pseudoscientific mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and \"vaccine detoxing\".\n[309]\nResults of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence\nto support mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety,\nruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression.\n[310] \nAn updated Cochrane review (2022) found evidence that music therapy\nlikely improves social interactions, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication skills.\n[311] \nThere has been early\nresearch on hyperbaric treatments in children with autism.\n[312] \nStudies on pet therapy have shown positive effects.\n[313]\nWhile infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism,\n[314] \nvaccination against rubella\ncan prevent many of those cases.\n[315]\nThere is no evidence of a cure for autism.\n[265][144] \nThe degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that\npeople lose their diagnosis of ASD;\n[316][317] \nthis occurs sometimes after intensive treatment\n[318] \nand sometimes not. It is\nnot known how often this outcome happens,\n[319] \nwith reported rates in unselected samples ranging from 3% to\n25%.\n[316][317] \nAlthough core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.\n[149] \nAcquiring\nlanguage before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent\nliving is unlikely in autistic people with higher support needs.\n[320]\nAmong others, academic Temple Grandin has advised against striving to cure autism, saying that if a cure were found, she\nwould choose to stay the way she is. She wrote, \"The skills that people with autism bring to the table should be nurtured\nfor their benefit and [for the benefit of] society\", adding, \"If you totally get rid of autism, you'd have nobody to fix your\nAlternative medicine\nPrevention\nPrognosis\n\nReports of autism cases per 1,000\nchildren rose considerably in the US\nfrom 1996 to 2007. It is unknown\nhow much growth came from\nchanges in rates of autism.\ncomputer in the future\".\n[321][322]\nThe prognosis of autism describes the developmental course, gradual autism development, regressive autism development,\ndifferential outcomes, academic performance and employment.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 1 in 100 children had\nautism during the period from 2012 to 2021 as that was the average estimate in\nstudies published during that period with a trend of increasing prevalence over\ntime. However, the study's 1% figure may reflect an underestimate of prevalence in\nlow- and middle-income countries.\n[9][323] \nThe number of people diagnosed has\nincreased considerably since the 1990s, which may be partly due to increased\nrecognition of the condition.\n[324]\nWhile rates of ASD are consistent across cultures, they vary greatly by gender, with\nboys diagnosed far more frequently than girls: 1 in 70 boys, but only 1 in 315 girls\nat eight years of age.\n[325] \nGirls, however, are more likely to have associated\ncognitive impairment, suggesting that less severe forms of ASD are likely being\nmissed in girls and women.\n[326] \nPrevalence differences may be a result of gender\ndifferences in expression of clinical symptoms, with women and girls with autism\nshowing less atypical behaviors and, therefore, less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis.\n[327]\nUsing DSM-5 criteria, 92% of the children diagnosed per DSM-IV with one of the disorders which is considered part of\nASD will still meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD. However, if both ASD and the social (pragmatic) communication\ndisorder categories of DSM-5 are combined, the prevalence of autism is mostly unchanged from the prevalence per the\nDSM-IV criteria. The best estimate for prevalence of ASD is 0.7% or 1 child in 143 children.\n[328] \nRelatively mild forms of\nautism, such as Asperger's as well as other developmental disorders, are included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.\n[329]\nASD rates were constant between 2014 and 2016 but twice the rate compared to the time period between 2011 and 2014\n(1.25 vs 2.47%). A Canadian meta-analysis from 2019 confirmed these effects as the profiles of autistic people became less\nand less different from the profiles of the general population.\n[330] \nIn the US, the rates for diagnosed ASD have been\nsteadily increasing since 2000 when records began being kept.\n[331] \nWhile it remains unclear whether this trend represents a\ntrue rise in incidence, it likely reflects changes in ASD diagnostic criteria, improved detection, and increased public\nawareness of autism.\n[332] \nIn 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and\nover in the UK was 1.1%.\n[333] \nA 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD.\n[334]\nRates of autism are poorly understood in many low- and middle-income countries, which affects the accuracy of global\nASD prevalence estimates,\n[335] \nbut it is thought that most autistic people live in low- and middle-income countries.\n[336]\nIn 2020, the Centers for Disease Control's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network reported\nthat approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States (1 in 34 boys, and 1 in 144 girls) is diagnosed with an autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD), based on data collected in 2016.\n[337][338] \nThis estimate is a 10% increase from the 1 in 59 rate in\n2014, a 105% increase from the 1 in 110 rate in 2006, and a 176% increase from the 1 in 150 rate in 2000.\n[337] \nDiagnostic\ncriteria for ASD have changed significantly since the 1980s; for example, U.S. special-education autism classification was\nintroduced in 1994.\n[183]\nIn the UK, from 1998 to 2018, the autism diagnoses increased by 787%.\n[324] \nThis increase is largely attributable to\nchanges in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public\nawareness\n[339][340][341] \n(particularly among women),\n[324] \nthough unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled\nout.\n[342] \nThe available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased;\n[339] \na real\nincrease would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental\nfactors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.\n[343] \nIt has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism\nand is not a cause of any increase in autism prevalence rates, if any change in the rate of autism exists at all.\n[201]\nEpidemiology\n\nMales have higher likelihood of being diagnosed with ASD than females. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly\nmodified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without.\n[183]\nSeveral theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is\nunconfirmed;\n[344] \none theory is that females are underdiagnosed.\n[345]\nThe risk of developing autism is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the\nknown increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability\nand show some signs of autism.\n[34] \nMost professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not\naffect the occurrence of autism.\n[346]\nAn autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements, that argues autism\nshould be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured,\n[347][348][349][350][351] \nalthough a minority of\nautistic people might still accept a cure.\n[352] \nWorldwide, events related to autism include World Autism Awareness Day,\nAutism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others.\n[353][354][355][356]\nSocial-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural\ncomparisons ... and research on social movements.\"\n[357] \nMany autistic people have been successful in their fields.\n[358]\nSome autistic people, as well as a growing number of researchers,\n[13] \nhave advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view\nthat autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.\n[359][360] \nCritics have\nbemoaned the entrenchment of some of these groups' opinions.\n[361][362][363][364]\nThe neurodiversity movement and the autism rights movement are social movements within the context of disability rights,\nemphasizing the concept of neurodiversity, which describes the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the\nhuman brain rather than a disorder to be cured.\n[349][108] \nThe autism rights movement advocates including greater\nacceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of those without\nautism;\n[365] \nand the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group.\n[365][366]\nAutism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural\nvariation in the \nhuman genome.\n[349] \nThese movements are not without detractors; a common argument against\nneurodiversity activists is that most of them have relatively low support needs, or are self-diagnosed, and do not represent\nthe views of autistic people with higher support needs.\n[366][367][368] \nJacquiline den Houting explores this critique,\ndetermining that the voices of low-support needs autistics are \"some of the most influential within the neurodiversity\nmovement, although admittedly these voices are a minority within the advocacy community\"; she suggests this is in part a\nshortcoming of the wider neurotypical community, referencing non-speaking self-advocate Amy Sequenzia's\nwriting.\n[369][370] \nPier Jaarsma and Stellan Welin make the argument that only high-functioning autistic people should be\nincluded under the neurodiversity banner, as low-functioning autists' condition may rightfully be viewed as a disability.\n[371]\nThe concept of neurodiversity is contentious in autism advocacy and research groups and has led to infighting.\n[372][373]\nHistory\nSociety and culture\nNeurodiversity movement\nEvents\n\nSince 2011, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network has celebrated April as Autism Acceptance Month. In 2021, the Autism\nSociety of America urged organizations to retitle Autism Awareness Day as Autism Acceptance Day, to focus on \"more\nfully integrating those 1 in 54 Americans living with autism into our social fabric\".\n[374]\nOver the years, multiple organizations have tried to capture the essence of autism in symbols. In 1963, the board for the\nNational Autistic Society, led by Gerald Gasson, proposed the \"puzzle piece\" as a symbol for autism, because it fit their\nview of autism as a \"puzzling condition\".\n[375] \nIn 1999, the Autism Society adopted the puzzle ribbon as the universal sign\nof autism awareness.\n[375] \nAs of 2023, the puzzle ribbon has negative associations, such as \"implications of autistic people\nas incomplete and...association with autism hate groups\".\n[374]\nIn 2004, neurodiversity advocates Amy and Gwen Nelson conjured the \"rainbow infinity symbol\". It was initially the logo\nfor their website, Aspies for Freedom. Nowadays, the prismatic colors are often associated with the neurodiversity\nmovement in general.\n[376] \nThe autism spectrum has also been symbolized by the infinity symbol itself.\n[377]\nIn 2018, Julian Morgan wrote the article \"Light It Up Gold\", a response to Autism Speaks's \"Light It Up Blue\" campaign,\nlaunched in 2007.\n[378][379] \nAurum is Latin for gold,\n[376] \nand gold has been used to symbolize autism, since both words\nstart with \"Au\". The flag implements a gradient to represent the Pride Movement and incorporates a golden infinity symbol\nas its focal point.\n[380]\nThe puzzle piece\nsymbol as used in the\nautism awareness\nribbon used by Autism\nSpeaks from 2005\nand now has negative\nassociations\nAutism infinity symbol\nfrom 2013, featuring a\nrainbow gradient from\nleft to right\nGold infinity loop,\nfollowing Julian\nMorgan's 2018 push\nto use gold for autism\nAn autistic pride flag was created in 2005 by Aspies for Freedom for the first Autistic Pride Day, featuring a rainbow\ninfinity symbol on a white background.\n[381]\nAs the rainbow infinity on a white background has become increasingly viewed as representative of neurodiversity in\ngeneral,\n[376] \nseveral designs have been proposed for an autistic-specific flag.\n[382] \nIn 2023, the People's History Museum\nfeatured a 2015 autistic pride design by Joseph Redford, featuring a rainbow infinity symbol, a green background for being\ntrue to one's nature, and a purple background for neurodiversity.\n[383]\nSymbols and flags\nSymbols\nFlags\n\nAn autistic/neurodiversity pride flag\nfeaturing a rainbow infinity, based\non a design from 2013\nThe 2015 autistic pride flag by\nJoseph Redford\nFamilies who care for an autistic child face added stress from a number of different causes.\n[384][385] \nParents may struggle\nto understand the diagnosis and to find appropriate care options. They often take a negative view of the diagnosis, and may\nstruggle emotionally.\n[386] \nMore than half of parents over age 50 are still living with their child, as about 85% of autistic\npeople have difficulties living independently.\n[387] \nSome studies also find decreased earnings among parents who care for\nautistic children.\n[388][389] \nSiblings of children with ASD report greater admiration and less conflict with the affected sibling\nthan siblings of unaffected children, like siblings of children with Down syndrome. But they reported lower levels of\ncloseness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of autistic people have a greater risk of\nnegative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.\n[390]\nOutline of autism\nAnimal model of autism\nAutism and memory\nAutism spectrum disorders in the media\nAutistic art\nControversies in autism\nGlobal perceptions of autism\nList of autistic fictional characters\nList of films about autism\nViolence and autism\nEmployment for people with autism\na.

Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied\nor even considered consciousness. In some explanations, it is\nsynonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind.\nIn the past, it was one's \"inner life\", the world of introspection, of\nprivate thought, imagination and volition.\n[2] \nToday, it often includes\nany kind of cognition, experience, feeling or perception. It may be\nawareness, awareness of awareness, metacognition, or self-\nawareness either continuously changing or not.\n[3][4] \nThe disparate\nrange of research, notions and speculations raises a curiosity about\nwhether the right questions are being asked.\n[5]\nExamples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations\nare: ordered distinction between self and environment, simple\nwakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by \"looking\nwithin\"; being a metaphorical \"stream\" of contents, or being a\nmental state, mental event, or mental process of the brain.\nThe words \"conscious\" and \"consciousness\" in the English language date to the 17th century, and the first\nrecorded use of \"conscious\" as a simple adjective was applied figuratively to inanimate objects (\"the\nconscious Groves\", 1643).\n[6]: 175 \nIt derived from the Latin\n \nconscius (con- \"together\" and \nscio \n\"to know\")\nwhich meant \"knowing with\" or \"having joint or common knowledge with another\", especially as in\nsharing a secret.\n[7] \nThomas Hobbes in\n \nLeviathan \n(1651) wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one\nand the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.\"\n[8] \nThere were also many occurrences\nin Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as \"knowing with oneself\", or in other\nwords \"sharing knowledge with oneself about something\". This phrase has the figurative sense of\n\"knowing that one knows\", which is something like the modern English word \"conscious\", but it was\nrendered into English as \"conscious to oneself\" or \"conscious unto oneself\". For example, Archbishop\nUssher wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\".\n[9]\nThe Latin conscientia, literally 'knowledge-with', first appears in Roman juridical texts by writers such as\nCicero. It means a kind of shared knowledge with moral value, specifically what a witness knows of\nsomeone else's deeds.\n[10][11] \nAlthough René Descartes (1596–1650), writing in Latin, is generally taken to\nbe the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way less like the traditional meaning and more like the way\nmodern English speakers would use \"conscience\", his meaning is nowhere defined.\n[12] \nIn Search after\nEtymology\n\nJohn Locke, a 17th-century\nBritish Age of Enlightenment\nphilosopher\nAbout forty meanings\nattributed to the term\nconsciousness can be\nidentified and\ncategorized based on\nfunctions and\nexperiences. The\nprospects for reaching\nany single, agreed-\nupon, theory-\nindependent definition\nof consciousness\nappear remote.\n[19]\nTruth (Regulæ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale, Amsterdam 1701) he\nwrote the word with a gloss: conscientiâ, vel interno testimonio (translatable as \"conscience, or internal\ntestimony\").\n[13][14] \nIt might mean the knowledge of the value of one’s own thoughts.\n[12]\nThe origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to\nJohn Locke who defined the word in his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, published in 1690, as \"the perception of what passes in a\nman's own mind\".\n[15][16] \nThe essay strongly influenced 18th-century\nBritish philosophy, and Locke's definition appeared in Samuel Johnson's\ncelebrated \nDictionary \n(1755).\n[17]\nThe French term conscience is defined roughly like English\n\"consciousness\" in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's\nEncyclopédie as \"the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have\nfrom what we do\".\n[18]\nScholars are divided as to whether Aristotle had a concept of consciousness.\nHe does not use any single word or terminology that is clearly similar to the\nphenomenon or concept defined by John Locke. Victor Caston contends that\nAristotle did have a concept more clearly similar to perception.\n[20]\nModern dictionary definitions of the word consciousness evolved over\nseveral centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings, with\nsome differences that have been controversial, such as the distinction between\ninward awareness and perception of the physical world, or the distinction\nbetween conscious and unconscious, or the notion of a mental entity or\nmental activity that is not physical.\nThe common-usage definitions of consciousness in Webster's Third New\nInternational Dictionary (1966) are as follows:\n1. awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact; intuitively perceived\nknowledge of something in one's inner self\ninward awareness of an external object, state, or fact\nconcerned awareness; INTEREST, CONCERN—often used with an attributive noun [e.g.\nclass consciousness]\n2. the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought; mind in\nthe broadest possible sense; something in nature that is distinguished from the physical\n3. the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which\nan individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span—compare\nSTREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS\n4. waking life (as that to which one returns after sleep, trance, fever) wherein all one's mental\npowers have returned . . .\n5. the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is immediately available to\nthe ego—compare PRECONSCIOUS, UNCONSCIOUS\nThe problem of definition\n\nThe Cambridge English Dictionary defines consciousness as \"the state of understanding and realizing\nsomething\".\n[21] \nThe \nOxford Living Dictionary \ndefines consciousness as \"[t]he state of being aware of and\nresponsive to one's surroundings\", \"[a] person's awareness or perception of something\", and \"[t]he fact of\nawareness by the mind of itself and the world\".\n[22]\nPhilosophers have attempted to clarify technical distinctions by using a jargon of their own. The\ncorresponding entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998) reads:\nConsciousness\nPhilosophers have used the term consciousness for four main topics: knowledge in\ngeneral, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and\nphenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just\nin case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver\none's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is\n'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The\nclearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-\nsensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative\nexperiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought,\nas in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality\nseem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.\n[23]\nDuring the early 19th century, the emerging field of geology inspired a popular metaphor that the mind\nlikewise had hidden layers \"which recorded the past of the individual\".\n[24]: 3 \nBy 1875, most psychologists\nbelieved that \"consciousness was but a small part of mental life\",\n[24]: 3 \nand this idea underlie the goal of\nFreudian therapy, to expose the unconscious layer of the mind.\nOther metaphors from various sciences inspired other analyses of the mind, for example: Johann Friedrich\nHerbart described ideas as being attracted and repulsed like magnets; John Stuart Mill developed the idea of\n\"mental chemistry\" and \"mental compounds\", and Edward B. Titchener sought the \"structure\" of the mind\nby analyzing its \"elements\". The abstract idea of states of consciousness mirrored the concept of states of\nmatter.\nIn 1892, William James noted that the \"ambiguous word 'content' has been recently invented instead of\n'object'\" and that the metaphor of mind as a container seemed to minimize the dualistic problem of how\n\"states of consciousness can know\" things, or objects;\n[25]: 465 \nby 1899 psychologists were busily studying\nthe \"contents of conscious experience by introspection and experiment\".\n[26]: 365 \nAnother popular metaphor\nwas James's doctrine of the stream of consciousness, with continuity, fringes, and transitions.\n[25]: vii [a]\nJames discussed the difficulties of describing and studying psychological phenomena, recognizing that\ncommonly-used terminology was a necessary and acceptable starting point towards more precise,\nscientifically justified language. Prime examples were phrases like inner experience and personal\nconsciousness:\nThe first and foremost concrete fact which every one will affirm to belong to his inner experience\nis the fact that consciousness of some sort goes on. 'States of mind' succeed each other in him.\n[...] But everyone knows what the terms mean [only] in a rough way; [...] When I say every 'state'\nor 'thought' is part of a personal consciousness, 'personal consciousness' is one of the terms in\nquestion. Its meaning we know so long as no one asks us to define it, but to give an accurate\nTraditional metaphors for mind\n\naccount of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks. [...] The only states of consciousness that\nwe naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses, minds, selves, concrete particular\nI's and you's. \n[25]: 152–153\nPrior to the 20th century, philosophers treated the phenomenon of consciousness as the \"inner world [of]\none's own mind\", and introspection was the mind \"attending to\" itself,\n[b] \nan activity seemingly distinct from\nthat of perceiving the 'outer world' and its physical phenomena. In 1892 William James noted the distinction\nalong with doubts about the inward character of the mind:\n'Things' have been doubted, but thoughts and feelings have never been doubted. The outer world,\nbut never the inner world, has been denied. Everyone assumes that we have direct introspective\nacquaintance with our thinking activity as such, with our consciousness as something inward and\ncontrasted with the outer objects which it knows. Yet I must confess that for my part I cannot feel\nsure of this conclusion. [...] It seems as if consciousness as an inner activity were rather a\npostulate than a sensibly given fact...\n[25]: 467\nBy the 1960s, for many philosophers and psychologists who talked about consciousness, the word no\nlonger meant the 'inner world' but an indefinite, large category called awareness, as in the following\nexample:\nIt is difficult for modern Western man to grasp that the Greeks really had no concept of\nconsciousness in that they did not class together phenomena as varied as problem solving,\nremembering, imagining, perceiving, feeling pain, dreaming, and acting on the grounds that all\nthese are manifestations of being aware or being conscious.\n[28]: 4\nMany philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does\nnot involve circularity or fuzziness.\n[29] \nIn The Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology (1989 edition), Stuart\nSutherland emphasized external awareness, and expressed a skeptical attitude more than a definition:\nConsciousness—The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is\nimpossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness\nmeans. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be\nconscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating\nbut elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved.\nNothing worth reading has been written on it.\n[29]\nUsing 'awareness', however, as a definition or synonym of consciousness is not a simple matter:\nFrom introspection to awareness\n\nIf awareness of the environment . . . is the criterion of consciousness, then even the protozoans\nare conscious. If awareness of awareness is required, then it is doubtful whether the great apes\nand human infants are conscious.\n[26]\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood by the majority of\npeople despite the difficulty philosophers have had defining it.\n[30] \nMax Velmans proposed that the\n\"everyday understanding of consciousness\" uncontroversially \"refers to experience itself rather than any\nparticular thing that we observe or experience\" and he added that consciousness \"is [therefore] exemplified\nby all the things that we observe or experience\",\n[31]: 4 \nwhether thoughts, feelings, or perceptions. Velmans\nnoted however, as of 2009, that there was a deep level of \"confusion and internal division\"\n[31] \namong\nexperts about the phenomenon of consciousness, because researchers lacked \"a sufficiently well-specified\nuse of the term...to agree that they are investigating the same thing\".\n[31]: 3 \nHe argued additionally that \"pre-\nexisting theoretical commitments\" to competing explanations of consciousness might be a source of bias.\nWithin the \"modern consciousness studies\" community the technical phrase 'phenomenal consciousness' is a\ncommon synonym for all forms of awareness, or simply 'experience',\n[31]: 4 \nwithout differentiating between\ninner and outer, or between higher and lower types. With advances in brain research, \"the presence or\nabsence of experienced phenomena\"\n[31]: 3 \nof any kind underlies the work of those neuroscientists who seek\n\"to analyze the precise relation of conscious phenomenology to its associated information processing\" in the\nbrain.\n[31]: 10 \nThis neuroscientific goal is to find the \"neural correlates of consciousness\" (NCC). One\ncriticism of this goal is that it begins with a theoretical commitment to the neurological origin of all\n\"experienced phenomena\" whether inner or outer.\n[c] \nAlso, the fact that the easiest 'content of consciousness'\nto be so analyzed is \"the experienced three-dimensional world (the phenomenal world) beyond the body\nsurface\"\n[31]: 4 \ninvites another criticism, that most consciousness research since the 1990s, perhaps because\nof bias, has focused on processes of external perception.\n[33]\nFrom a history of psychology perspective, Julian Jaynes rejected popular but \"superficial views of\nconsciousness\"\n[2]: 447 \nespecially those which equate it with \"that vaguest of terms, experience\".\n[24]: 8 \nIn\n1976 he insisted that if not for introspection, which for decades had been ignored or taken for granted rather\nthan explained, there could be no \"conception of what consciousness is\"\n[24]: 18 \nand in 1990, he reaffirmed\nthe traditional idea of the phenomenon called 'consciousness', writing that \"its denotative definition is, as it\nwas for Descartes, Locke, and Hume, what is introspectable\".\n[2]: 450 \nJaynes saw consciousness as an\nimportant but small part of human mentality, and he asserted: \"there can be no progress in the science of\nconsciousness until ... what is introspectable [is] sharply distinguished\"\n[2]: 447 \nfrom the unconscious\nprocesses of cognition such as perception, reactive awareness and attention, and automatic forms of\nlearning, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n[24]: 21-47\nThe cognitive science point of view—with an inter-disciplinary perspective involving fields such as\npsychology, linguistics and anthropology\n[34]\n—requires no agreed definition of \"consciousness\" but studies\nthe interaction of many processes besides perception. For some researchers, consciousness is linked to some\nkind of \"selfhood\", for example to certain pragmatic issues such as the feeling of agency and the effects of\nregret\n[33] \nand action on experience of one's own body or social identity.\n[35] \nSimilarly Daniel Kahneman,\nwho focused on systematic errors in perception, memory and decision-making, has differentiated between\ntwo kinds of mental processes, or cognitive \"systems\":\n[36] \nthe \"fast\" activities that are primary, automatic\nInfluence on research\n\nand \"cannot be turned off\",\n[36]: 22 \nand the \"slow\", deliberate, effortful activities of a secondary system\n\"often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration\".\n[36]: 13 \nKahneman's\ntwo systems have been described as \"roughly corresponding to unconscious and conscious\nprocesses\".\n[37]: 8 \nThe two systems can interact, for example in sharing the control of attention.\n[36]: 22 \nWhile\nSystem 1 can be impulsive, \"System 2 is in charge of self-control\",\n[36]: 26 \nand \"When we think of\nourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and\ndecides what to think about and what to do.\"\n[36]: 21\nSome have argued that we should eliminate the concept from our understanding of the mind, a position\nknown as consciousness semanticism.\n[38]\nIn medicine, a \"level of consciousness\" terminology is used to describe a patient's arousal and\nresponsiveness, which can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension,\nthrough disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in\nresponse to painful stimuli.\n[39] \nIssues of practical concern include how the level of consciousness can be\nassessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which\nconsciousness is impaired or disrupted.\n[40] \nThe degree or level of consciousness is measured by\nstandardized behavior observation scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale.\nMost writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of\nview, and have organized their material accordingly. For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a\nhistorical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for\nexample, Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic\nissues.\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.\n[41] \nWhile most\npeople have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,\n[30] \nskeptics argue\nthat this intuition is too narrow, either because the concept of consciousness is embedded in our intuitions,\nor because we all are illusions. Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of\nconsciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and\nbody, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of\nentities, or identities, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of \"consciousness\" we end up leading\nourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and\nlinguistic understandings.\n[42]\nNed Block argued that discussions on consciousness often failed to properly distinguish phenomenal (P-\nconsciousness) from access (A-consciousness), though these terms had been used before Block.\n[43] \nP-\nconsciousness, according to Block, is raw experience: it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations,\nemotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center. These experiences, considered\nindependently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the\nPhilosophy of mind\nCoherence of the concept\nTypes\n\nphenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of\nbehavior. So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we\nintrospect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the\npast is access conscious, and so on. Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the\nvalidity of this distinction,\n[44] \nothers have broadly accepted it. David Chalmers has argued that A-\nconsciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness\nis much more challenging: he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.\n[45]\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story. William\nLycan, for example, argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct\ntypes of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness of;\nstate/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-\nconsciousness)—and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.\n[46]\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can\nexist separately. Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have\nbeen some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block, for instance, suggests the case of a \"zombie\" that\nis computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat\nskeptical concluding \"I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-\nconsciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility.\"\n[47]\nSam Harris observes: \"At the level of your experience, you are not a body of cells, organelles, and atoms;\nyou are consciousness and its ever-changing contents\".\n[48] \nSeen in this way, consciousness is a subjectively\nexperienced, ever-present field in which things (the contents of consciousness) come and go.\nChristopher Tricker argues that this field of consciousness is symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the\nDaoist classic the Zhuangzi. This bird's name is Of a Flock (peng 鵬), yet its back is countless thousands of\nmiles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens. \"Like Of a Flock, whose wings arc\nacross the heavens, the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon. At the same time, the wings of\nevery other being's consciousness span to the horizon. You are of a flock, one bird among kin.\"\n[49]\nMental processes (such as consciousness) and physical processes (such as brain events) seem to be\ncorrelated, however the specific nature of the connection is unknown.\nThe first influential philosopher to discuss this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he gave\nis known as mind–body dualism. Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial\ndomain he called res cogitans (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he\ncalled \nres extensa \n(the realm of extension).\n[50] \nHe suggested that the interaction between these two domains\noccurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the pineal gland.\n[51]\nAlthough it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have\nbeen happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed.\n[52]\nHowever, no alternative solution has gained general acceptance. Proposed solutions can be divided broadly\ninto two categories: dualist solutions that maintain Descartes's rigid distinction between the realm of\nDistinguishing consciousness from its contents\nMind–body problem\n\nIllustration of mind–body dualism by\nRené Descartes. Inputs are passed\nby the sensory organs to the pineal\ngland, and from there to the\nimmaterial spirit.\nconsciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for\nhow the two realms relate to each other; and monist solutions that\nmaintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which\nconsciousness and matter are both aspects. Each of these categories\nitself contains numerous variants. The two main types of dualism\nare substance dualism (which holds that the mind is formed of a\ndistinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics), and\nproperty dualism (which holds that the laws of physics are\nuniversally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind). The three\nmain types of monism are physicalism (which holds that the mind\nconsists of matter organized in a particular way), idealism (which\nholds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is\nmerely an illusion), and neutral monism (which holds that both\nmind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself\nidentical to neither of them). There are also, however, a large\nnumber of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to\nany of these schools of thought.\n[53]\nSince the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple\nmechanical principles governing the entire universe, some\nphilosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms.\nThe first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie, in his book\nMan a Machine \n(L'homme machine). His arguments, however, were very abstract.\n[54] \nThe most influential\nmodern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience. Theories proposed\nby neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman\n[55] \nand Antonio Damasio,\n[56] \nand by philosophers such as\nDaniel Dennett,\n[57] \nseek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain.\nMany other neuroscientists, such as Christof Koch,\n[58] \nhave explored the neural basis of consciousness\nwithout attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists\nworking in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs\nthat can simulate or embody consciousness.\n[59]\nA few theoretical physicists have argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the\nholistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several\ntheorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness.\n[60] \nNotable theories\nfalling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the\nOrch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer\ndescriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of\nthe quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi,\nJ. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel\n[61] \ncould falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on\nquantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the\narguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.\n[62] \nEmpirical evidence is\nagainst the notion of quantum consciousness, an experiment about wave function collapse led by Catalina\nCurceanu in 2022 suggests that quantum consciousness, as suggested by Roger Penrose and Stuart\nHameroff, is highly implausible.\n[63]\n\nApart from the general question of the \"hard problem\" of consciousness (which is, roughly speaking, the\nquestion of how mental experience can arise from a physical basis\n[64]\n), a more specialized question is how\nto square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with\nthe customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is\nthe philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.\nMany philosophers consider experience to be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can\nonly fully be known from the inside, subjectively. The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem\ntraditionally stated as the following epistemological question: Given that I can only observe the behavior of\nothers, how can I know that others have minds?\n[65] \nThe problem of other minds is particularly acute for\npeople who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in\nprinciple to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a\nhuman being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness.\n[66] \nRelated issues have also been studied\nextensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois,\n[67] \nand by Colin Allen (a professor at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh) regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.\n[68]\nThe most commonly given answer is that we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that\nthey resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must\nbe like us in other ways, including having experiences of the sort that we do.\n[69] \nThere are, however, a\nvariety of problems with that explanation. For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by\npostulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe.\n[69] \nSome philosophers, such\nas Daniel Dennett in a research paper titled \"The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies\", argue that\npeople who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying.\n[70] \nMore broadly,\nphilosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected\nin behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. A\nmore straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can\ndo, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.\n[71]\nFor many decades, consciousness as a research topic was avoided by the majority of mainstream scientists,\nbecause of a general feeling that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied\nusing objective experimental methods.\n[72] \nIn 1975 George Mandler published an influential psychological\nstudy which distinguished between slow, serial, and limited conscious processes and fast, parallel and\nextensive unconscious ones.\n[73] \nThe Science and Religion Forum\n[74] \n1984 annual conference, 'From\nArtificial Intelligence to Human Consciousness' identified the nature of consciousness as a matter for\ninvestigation; Donald Michie was a keynote speaker. Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of\nneuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies,\ngiving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books,\n[75] \njournals such as \nConsciousness and\nCognition, Frontiers in Consciousness Research, Psyche, and the Journal of Consciousness Studies, along\nwith regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of\nConsciousness\n[76] \nand the Society for Consciousness Studies.\nProblem of other minds\nScientific study\n\nThe Necker cube, an\nambiguous image\nModern medical and psychological investigations into consciousness are based on psychological\nexperiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli),\n[77] \nand\non case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. Broadly viewed,\nscientific approaches are based on two core concepts. The first identifies the content of consciousness with\nthe experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness\nthat has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose\nbehavior is impaired. In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness\nobjectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms\nthat underlie it.\n[58]\nExperimental research on consciousness presents special difficulties, due to\nthe lack of a universally accepted operational definition. In the majority of\nexperiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are\nhuman, and the criterion used is verbal report: in other words, subjects are\nasked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as\nobservations of the contents of consciousness.\n[78] \nFor example, subjects\nwho stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience\nit \"flipping\" between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself\nremains the same.\n[79] \nThe objective is to understand the relationship\nbetween the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report)\nand the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several\nparadigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by\nstimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing\npriming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).\n[80]\nVerbal report is widely considered to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number\nof issues.\n[81] \nFor one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other\nbranches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult to make sense\nof the idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how\nsuch an error could be detected.\n[82] \nDaniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls\nheterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his\nideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted.\n[83] \nAnother issue with verbal report as a criterion\nis that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: this approach cannot be used to study\nconsciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair\nlanguage. As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is\npossible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: a philosophical\nzombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.\n[84]\nAlthough verbal report is in practice the \"gold standard\" for ascribing consciousness, it is not the only\npossible criterion.\n[81] \nIn medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal,\nbrain activity, and purposeful movement. The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness\nwhen verbal behavior is absent.\n[85][86] \nThe scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and\npurposeful movement is very extensive. Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed,\nhowever, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully\nMeasurement\n\nSchema of the neural processes underlying consciousness, from Christof Koch\nin a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness.\n[80] \nStudies related to the\nneuroscience of free will have also shown that the influence consciousness has on decision-making is not\nalways straight-forward.\n[87]\nAnother approach applies specifically to the study of self-awareness, that is, the ability to distinguish oneself\nfrom others. In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the\nmirror test. The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a\nmirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or\nfur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus\nindicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves.\n[88] \nHumans\n(older than 18 months) and other great apes, bottlenose dolphins, orcas, pigeons, European magpies, and\nelephants have all been observed to pass this test.\n[89]\nA major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship\nbetween the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains\n—that is, studies of the neural correlates of consciousness. The hope is to find that activity in a particular\npart of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of\nconscious awareness. Several brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, have been used for\nphysical measures of brain activity in these studies.\n[90]\nAnother idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-\nfrequency (gamma band) oscillations in brain activity. This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by\nChristof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called binding\nproblem, by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience.\n[91]\nRodolfo Llinás, for example, proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance\nwhere the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus)\nthalamocortical systems (context) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations.\n[92]\nA number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to\nproduce consciousness: it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the\nprimary visual cortex (V1) show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.\n[93] \nHigher brain areas are seen as\nmore promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions\ncollectively known as executive functions.\n[94] \nThere is substantial evidence that a \"top-down\" flow of\nneural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of\nNeural correlates\n\nconscious awareness than a \"bottom-up\" flow of activity.\n[95] \nThe prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate\narea, however: studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually\nresponsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when\nconflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).\n[96]\nFurthermore, top-down feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the\nperipheral visual field, as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical arguments;\n[97] \nnevertheless\nhumans can perceive visual inputs in the peripheral visual field arising from bottom-up V1 neural\nactivities.\n[97][98] \nMeanwhile, bottom-up V1 activities for the central visual fields can be vetoed, and thus\nmade invisible to perception, by the top-down feedback, when these bottom-up signals are inconsistent with\nthe brain's internal model of the visual world.\n[97][98]\nModulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In contrast to the raw electrical\nresponses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli\ncorrelates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal\nexperience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić it has been\nshown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of\nfiring rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony.\n[99] \nAn fMRI investigation\nsuggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas.\n[100] \nThis indicates that, in the\nprimary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia\n—at least for some type of qualia.\nIn 2013, the perturbational complexity index (PCI) was proposed, a measure of the algorithmic complexity\nof the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was\nshown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are\nin deep sleep or in a vegetative state,\n[101] \nmaking it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of\nconsciousness states.\nAssuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of\nevolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example,\nassuming that birds are conscious—a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the\nextensive cognitive repertoire of birds—there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the\nprincipal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a\ncomparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are\nthey? What homologs can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al.,\n[102] \nis that\nsome of the major theories for the mammalian brain \n[103][104][105] \nalso appear to be valid for the avian\nbrain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous\ncounterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch,\n[103] \nEdelman and\nTononi,\n[104] \nand Cotterill \n[105] \nseem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious.\nEdelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans\nand non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human\nlanguage capacity.\n[104] \nCertain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the\nhypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of\nthe mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian\nhomologs have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles\n[106][107] \nseems incompatible, since a\nstructural homolog/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian\n\nconsciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between\navian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than\nsuggested by many leading neuroscientists.\nJoaquin Fuster of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans,\nalong with the areas of Wernicke and Broca, as being of particular importance to the development of human\nlanguage capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in\nhumans.\n[108]\nA study in 2016 looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem that were associated with coma and\nvegetative states. A small region of the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was\nsuggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with two cortical regions, the left ventral\nanterior insular cortex, and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. These three regions may work together\nas a triad to maintain consciousness.\n[109]\nA wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed.\n[110][111][112] \nAdrian Doerig and\ncolleagues list 13 notable theories,\n[112] \nwhile Anil Seth and Tim Bayne list 22 notable theories.\n[111]\nGlobal workspace theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the\ncognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in 1988.\n[113] \nBaars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater,\nwith conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage.\n[113] \nThis theater integrates inputs from a\nvariety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to\nunconscious networks (represented in the metaphor by a broad, unlit \"audience\").\n[113] \nThe theory has since\nbeen expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel\nNaccache.\n[114]\nIntegrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness resides in the information being processed\nand arises once the information reaches a certain level of complexity.\n[115] \nAdditionally, IIT is one of the\nonly leading theories of consciousness that attempts to create a 1:1 mapping between conscious states and\nprecise, formal mathematical descriptions of those mental states. Proponents of this model suggest that it\nmay provide a physical grounding for consciousness in neurons, as they provide the mechanism by which\ninformation is integrated.\n[115]\nOrchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum level\ninside neurons. The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is\norchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. However the details of the mechanism would go\nbeyond current quantum theory.\n[116]\nIn 2011, Graziano and Kastner\n[117] \nproposed the \"attention schema\" theory of awareness. In that theory,\nspecific cortical areas, notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction, are used to\nbuild the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people. The same cortical machinery is also used to\nattribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as\nhemispatial neglect. In the attention schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and\nattributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. Attention\nModels\n\nis a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated\nsignals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be\naware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.\nThe entropic brain is a theory of conscious states informed by neuroimaging research with psychedelic\ndrugs. The theory suggests that the brain in primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, early\npsychosis and under the influence of psychedelic drugs, is in a disordered state; normal waking\nconsciousness constrains some of this freedom and makes possible metacognitive functions such as internal\nself-administered reality testing and self-awareness.\n[118][119][120][121] \nCriticism has included questioning\nwhether the theory has been adequately tested.\n[122]\nIn 2017, work by David Rudrauf and colleagues, including Karl Friston, applied the active inference\nparadigm to consciousness, a model of how sensory data is integrated with priors in a process of projective\ntransformation. The authors argue that, while their model identifies a key relationship between computation\nand phenomenology, it does not completely solve the hard problem of consciousness or completely close\nthe explanatory gap.\n[123]\nThe emergence of consciousness during biological evolution remains a topic of ongoing scientific inquiry.\nThe survival value of consciousness is still a matter of exploration and understanding. While consciousness\nappears to play a crucial role in human cognition, decision-making, and self-awareness, its adaptive\nsignificance across different species remains a subject of debate.\nSome people question whether consciousness has any survival value. Some argue that consciousness is a\nby-product of evolution. Thomas Henry Huxley for example defends in an essay titled \"On the Hypothesis\nthat Animals are Automata, and its History\" an epiphenomenalist theory of consciousness, according to\nwhich consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity—\"as the steam-whistle which accompanies\nthe work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery\".\n[124] \nTo this William James\nobjects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction\nimplying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of\nnatural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has\nhad a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious.\n[125][126] \nKarl Popper\ndevelops a similar evolutionary argument in the book The Self and Its Brain.\n[127]\nOpinions are divided on when and how consciousness first arose. It has been argued that consciousness\nemerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in\nmammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles.\n[128] \nOther authors date the origins of consciousness to the\nfirst animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago.\n[129]\nDonald Griffin suggests in his book\n Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness.\n[130]\nRegarding the primary function of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that\nphenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be\nindependent.\n[131] \nThis has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by\nGerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that\nreciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner.\n[132] \nEdelman also stresses the importance\nof the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of\nprimary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above).\nBiological function and evolution\n\nThese theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with\nconsciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate\nbetween a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it\nintegrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view\neasily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts.\nHowever, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and\nwhich kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role\nconscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness.\nObviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity\nrelated to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyzes, etc.)\nand many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness,\nas in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.\n[133] \nHence it remains unclear why any of it\nis conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article\nof Ezequiel Morsella.\n[133]\nAs noted earlier, even among writers who consider consciousness to be well-defined, there is widespread\ndispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it.\n[134] \nEdelman has described this\ndistinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary\nconsciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution\nof consciousness is faced with great difficulties. Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness\ncan be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that\nincreases \nfitness.\n[135] \nIn his article \"Evolution of consciousness\", John Eccles argued that special\nanatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness (\"[a]\npsychon ... linked to [a] dendron through quantum physics\").\n[136] \nBernard Baars proposed that once in\nplace, this \"recursive\" circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the\nfunctions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms.\n[137] \nPeter Carruthers has put forth one such\npotential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an\nindividual to make distinctions between appearance and reality.\n[138] \nThis ability would enable a creature to\nrecognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a\nmirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how\nthings appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.\nOther philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional\nadvantage in evolutionary processes.\n[139][140] \nNo one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why it\nwould not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a philosophical zombie) to\nachieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to\nthe difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and non-conscious organism\nO*, it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide.\n[141] \nAs a result, an exaptive\nexplanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve\nas an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in\nbrain size or cortical rearrangement.\n[129] \nConsciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in\nthe retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons\nwere wired.\n[142] \nSeveral scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the\n\nA Buddhist monk meditating\nimportance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and\nmemory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness (see Neural correlates section\nabove).\nThere are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent,\nincluding dreamless sleep or coma. There are also a variety of\ncircumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the\nworld in less drastic ways, producing what are known as altered states of\nconsciousness. Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced\nby drugs or brain damage.\n[143] \nAltered states can be accompanied by\nchanges in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of\ncontrol, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and\nchanges in meaning or significance.\n[144]\nThe two most widely accepted altered states are sleep and dreaming.\nAlthough dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an\noutside observer, each is associated with a distinct pattern of brain activity,\nmetabolic activity, and eye movement; each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and\ncognition. During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy\nthoughts, and their experiences do not cohere into a continuous narrative. During dream sleep, in contrast,\npeople who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous\nprogression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions.\n[145] \nThought processes\nduring the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality. Both dream and non-dream states are\nassociated with severe disruption of memory: it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state,\nand in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.\n[146]\nResearch conducted on the effects of partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who\nhave partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness.\n[147][148] \nIn partial epileptic\nseizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors,\nremain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures,\npatients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by\ndifficulty in focusing and shifting attention.\nA variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, have notable effects on consciousness.\n[149] \nThese range\nfrom a simple dulling of awareness produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities\nproduced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"), or most notably\nby the class of drugs known as psychedelics.\n[143] \nLSD, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine, and\nothers in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even\ndescribe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying\nthese effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol,\n[149] \nbut there is substantial\nevidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an\nessential role.\n[150]\nThere has been some research into physiological changes in yogis and people who practise various\ntechniques of meditation. Some research with brain waves during meditation has reported differences\nbetween those corresponding to ordinary relaxation and those corresponding to meditation. It has been\nAltered states\n\ndisputed, however, whether there is enough evidence to count these as physiologically distinct states of\nconsciousness.\n[151]\nThe most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist\nCharles Tart in the 1960s and 1970s. Tart analyzed a state of consciousness as made up of a number of\ncomponent processes, including exteroception (sensing the external world); interoception (sensing the\nbody); input-processing (seeing meaning); emotions; memory; time sense; sense of identity; evaluation and\ncognitive processing; motor output; and interaction with the environment.\n[152] \nEach of these, in his view,\ncould be altered in multiple ways by drugs or other manipulations. The components that Tart identified have\nnot, however, been validated by empirical studies. Research in this area has not yet reached firm\nconclusions, but a recent questionnaire-based study identified eleven significant factors contributing to drug-\ninduced states of consciousness: experience of unity; spiritual experience; blissful state; insightfulness;\ndisembodiment; impaired control and cognition; anxiety; complex imagery; elementary imagery; audio-\nvisual synesthesia; and changed meaning of percepts.\n[153]\nThe medical approach to consciousness is scientifically oriented. It derives from a need to treat people\nwhose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs. In medicine,\nconceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments. The\nmedical approach focuses mostly on the amount of consciousness a person has: in medicine, consciousness\nis assessed as a \"level\" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful\nresponsiveness at the high end.\n[154]\nConsciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially neurologists and anesthesiologists.\nPatients may have disorders of consciousness or may need to be anesthetized for a surgical procedure.\nPhysicians may perform consciousness-related interventions such as instructing the patient to sleep,\nadministering general anesthesia, or inducing medical coma.\n[154] \nAlso, bioethicists may be concerned with\nthe ethical implications of consciousness in medical cases of patients such as the Karen Ann Quinlan\ncase,\n[155] \nwhile neuroscientists may study patients with impaired consciousness in hopes of gaining\ninformation about how the brain works.\n[156]\nIn medicine, consciousness is examined using a set of procedures known as neuropsychological\nassessment.\n[85] \nThere are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient:\na simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial\nexpertise. The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical\nstimuli. If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and\ncommands. If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. A patient who\ncan answer all of these questions is said to be \"alert and oriented times four\" (sometimes denoted \"A&Ox4\"\non a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.\n[157]\nThe more complex procedure is known as a neurological examination, and is usually carried out by a\nneurologist in a hospital setting. A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated\nseries of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for\nMedical aspects\nAssessment\n\nsophisticated use of language. The outcome may be summarized using the Glasgow Coma Scale, which\nyields a number in the range 3–15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full\nconsciousness. The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging\nfrom \"no motor response\" to \"obeys commands\"), the best eye response (ranging from \"no eye opening\" to\n\"eyes opening spontaneously\") and the best verbal response (ranging from \"no verbal response\" to \"fully\noriented\"). There is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale, for children too young to be able to use\nlanguage.\n[154]\nIn 2013, an experimental procedure was developed to measure degrees of consciousness, the procedure\ninvolving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse, measuring resulting waves of electrical activity, and\ndeveloping a consciousness score based on the complexity of the brain activity.\n[158]\nMedical conditions that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness.\n[159] \nThis category\ngenerally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes also includes the\nless severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma.\n[159][160] \nDifferential diagnosis of these\ndisorders is an active area of biomedical research.\n[161][162][163] \nFinally, brain death results in possible\nirreversible disruption of consciousness.\n[159] \nWhile other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration\n(e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of\nconsciousness, they are not included in this category.\nDisorder Description\nLocked-in\nsyndrome\nThe patient has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and meaningful behavior (viz., eye-\nmovement), but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy.\nMinimally\nconscious state\nThe patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness and displays some\nmeaningful behavior.\nPersistent\nvegetative state\nThe patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness and only displays reflexive and\nnon-purposeful behavior.\nChronic coma The patient lacks awareness and sleep-wake cycles and only displays reflexive behavior.\nBrain death The patient lacks awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and brain-mediated reflexive behavior.\nMedical experts increasingly view anosognosia as a disorder of consciousness.\n[164] \nAnosognosia is a\nGreek-derived term meaning \"unawareness of disease\". This is a condition in which patients are disabled in\nsome way, most commonly as a result of a stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or\ndeny that there is anything wrong with them.\n[165] \nThe most frequently occurring form is seen in people\nwho have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to\na syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward\nobjects located to the left with respect to their bodies. Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed\non the left side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. When questioned about the obvious\nproblem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that does not make\nsense. Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: one\nfrequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the\nbed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg\nDisorders\n\ninto the bed with him. An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely\noccurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this\nclaim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.\n[166]\nOf the eight types of consciousness in the Lycan classification, some are detectable in utero and others\ndevelop years after birth. Psychologist and educator William Foulkes studied children's dreams and\nconcluded that prior to the shift in cognitive maturation that humans experience during ages five to\nseven,\n[167] \nchildren lack the Lockean consciousness that Lycan had labeled \"introspective consciousness\"\nand that Foulkes labels \"self-reflection\".\n[168] \nIn a 2020 paper, Katherine Nelson and Robyn Fivush use\n\"autobiographical consciousness\" to label essentially the same faculty, and agree with Foulkes on the timing\nof this faculty's acquisition. Nelson and Fivush contend that \"language is the tool by which humans create a\nnew, uniquely human form of consciousness, namely, autobiographical consciousness.\"\n[169] \nJulian Jaynes\nhad staked out these positions decades earlier.\n[170][171] \nCiting the developmental steps that lead the infant to\nautobiographical consciousness, Nelson and Fivush point to the acquisition of \"theory of mind\", calling\ntheory of mind \"necessary for autobiographical consciousness\" and defining it as \"understanding\ndifferences between one's own mind and others' minds in terms of beliefs, desires, emotions and thoughts.\"\nThey write, \"The hallmark of theory of mind, the understanding of false belief, occurs ... at five to six years\nof age.\"\n[172]\nThe topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds\nin an especially severe form, because non-human animals, lacking the ability to express human language,\ncannot tell humans about their experiences.\n[173] \nAlso, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question,\nbecause a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value,\nand that harming it is not morally wrong. Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for\nmistreatment of animals due to the fact that he believed only humans have a non-physical mind.\n[174] \nMost\npeople have a strong intuition that some animals, such as cats and dogs, are conscious, while others, such as\ninsects, are not; but the sources of this intuition are not obvious, and are often based on personal interactions\nwith pets and other animals they have observed.\n[173]\nPhilosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a\ncorrelate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas\nNagel spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled \"What Is it Like to Be a Bat?\". He said that\nan organism is conscious \"if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is\nlike for the organism\"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and\nbehavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way\nit does itself.\n[175] \nOther thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent.\n[176]\nSeveral psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a\nrange of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive—\nDonald Griffin's 2001 book\n Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.\n[130]\nOutside human adults\nIn children\nIn animals\n\nThomas Nagel argues that while a\nhuman might be able to imagine what\nit is like to be a bat by taking \"the\nbat's point of view\", it would still be\nimpossible \"to know what it is like for\na bat to be a bat.\" (Townsend's big-\neared bat pictured).\nOn July 7, 2012, eminent scientists from different branches of\nneuroscience gathered at the University of Cambridge to celebrate\nthe Francis Crick Memorial Conference, which deals with\nconsciousness in humans and pre-linguistic consciousness in\nnonhuman animals. After the conference, they signed in the\npresence of Stephen Hawking, the 'Cambridge Declaration on\nConsciousness', which summarizes the most important findings of\nthe survey:\n\"We decided to reach a consensus and make a statement directed to\nthe public that is not scientific. It's obvious to everyone in this room\nthat animals have consciousness, but it is not obvious to the rest of\nthe world. It is not obvious to the rest of the Western world or the\nFar East. It is not obvious to the society.\"\n[177]\n\"Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals ..., including all mammals and birds, and other\ncreatures, ... have the necessary neural substrates of consciousness and the capacity to exhibit intentional\nbehaviors.\"\n[178]\nThe idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the\nGreek myth of Pygmalion, who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish\nstories of the Golem, a magically animated homunculus built of clay.\n[179] \nHowever, the possibility of\nactually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace, in a set of notes\nwritten in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, a precursor (never built) to\nmodern electronic computers. Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the\nAnalytical Engine could think in a humanlike way. She wrote:\nIt is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the\npowers of the Analytical Engine. ... The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to\noriginate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis;\nbut it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in\nmaking available what we are already acquainted with.\n[180]\nOne of the most influential contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering\ncomputer scientist Alan Turing, titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Turing disavowed any\ninterest in terminology, saying that even \"Can machines think?\" is too loaded with spurious connotations to\nbe meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has\nbecome known as the Turing test.\n[181] \nTo pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well\nenough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a\ncounterargument to each of them. The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence\nas a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For\nexample, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is\nnecessarily conscious,\n[182] \nwhile David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test,\nyet fail to be conscious.\n[183] \nA third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once\nmachines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human\nIn artificial intelligence\n\nJohn Searle in December\n2005\nconsciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy\nbegin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology.\n[67][68]\nJürgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is the result of compression.\n[184] \nAs an agent sees\nrepresentation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called\nconsciousness.\nIn a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as \"the Chinese\nroom argument\", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of\nwhat he calls \"strong artificial intelligence (AI)\" that a computer program\ncan be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of \"weak AI\" that\ncomputer programs can be formatted to \"simulate\" conscious states. His\nown view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers\nby being essentially intentional due to the way human brains function\nbiologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but\nconsciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs\nare. To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a\nroom with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a\nbook that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired\nwith Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. In this\ncase, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a\nprogram. Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to\nprocess the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea\nwhat the questions and answers could possibly mean. If the experiment were done in English, since Searle\nknows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English\nquestions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve. Searle\nwould pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what\nhe is doing when he speaks English. Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs\ncan pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic\nmeaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.\n[185][186]\nIn the literature concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been second only to Turing's in the\nvolume of debate it has generated.\n[187] \nSearle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would take\nto make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was \"causal powers\" of the sort\nthat the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have\nsuggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to\npass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version,\n[188] \nwhich requires grounding the\nrobot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that\nits words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical\nbranch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.\n[189]\nIn 2014, Victor Argonov has suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on a machine's\nability to produce philosophical judgments.\n[190] \nHe argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as\nconscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or\nbinding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical\ndiscussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may\nimplicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures' consciousness). However, this test can be\n\nused only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that a machine is\nconscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be\ncaused by lack of the machine's intellect, not by absence of consciousness.\nWilliam James is usually credited with popularizing the idea that human consciousness flows like a stream,\nin his Principles of Psychology of 1890.\nAccording to James, the \"stream of thought\" is governed by five characteristics:\n[191]\n1. Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness.\n2. Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing.\n3. Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous.\n4. It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself.\n5. It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others.\nA similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term Citta-saṃtāna, which is\nusually translated as mindstream or \"mental continuum\". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness\nmanifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously\nchanging.\n[192] \nThe teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events.\n[192]\nThese triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a\nthought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events\ngenerated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour. The moment-by-\nmoment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a\nscientist who analyzes various phenomena in the world, or analyzes the material body including the organ\nbrain.\n[192] \nThe manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws,\nbiological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.\n[192] \nThe purpose of the Buddhist\npractice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.\n[193]\nIn the West, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science: \"stream of\nconsciousness as a narrative mode\" means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment\nthoughts and experiences of a character. This technique perhaps had its beginnings in the monologues of\nShakespeare's plays and reached its fullest development in the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf,\nalthough it has also been used by many other noted writers.\n[194]\nHere, for example, is a passage from Joyce's Ulysses about the thoughts of Molly Bloom:\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple\nof eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice\ndoing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he\nhad a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest\nmiser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she\nhad too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a\nbit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and\nStream of consciousness\nNarrative form\n\nlownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man\nwould look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces\nbut she was a well-educated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr\nRiordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her.\n[195]\nTo most philosophers, the word \"consciousness\" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world.\nTo writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God,\nor the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the\nphysical world.\nThe Canadian psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke, author of the 1901 book Cosmic Consciousness: A\nStudy in the Evolution of the Human Mind, distinguished between three types of consciousness: 'Simple\nConsciousness', awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; 'Self Consciousness', awareness of\nbeing aware, possessed only by humans; and 'Cosmic Consciousness', awareness of the life and order of the\nuniverse, possessed only by humans who have attained \"intellectual enlightenment or illumination\".\n[196]\nAnother thorough account of the spiritual approach is Ken Wilber's 1977 book The Spectrum of\nConsciousness, a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described\nconsciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at\nhigher levels.\n[197]\nOther examples include the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and\nStuart Hameroff.\n[198]\nBicameral mentality – Hypothesis in psychology\nChaitanya – Hindu philosophical concept\nClaustrum – Structure in the brain\nHabenula – Small bilateral neuronal structure in the brain of vertebrates\nModels of consciousness – Aspect of consciousness research\nPlant perception – Paranormal idea that plants are sentient\nSakshi – Pure awareness in Hindu philosophy\nVertiginous question – Philosophical argument by Benj Hellie\na.

As an AI assistant, my goal is to learn as much as I can in order to better understand and relate to humans. The information you provided helps give me more context and insight into the diversity of human minds and experiences.\n\nFrom what I understand, autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that exists on a spectrum and is characterized by differences in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. However, autism also often comes with unique strengths and abilities. Many autistic people view autism not as a disorder but as a form of neurological difference and diversity. There are ongoing debates between the medical model of autism as a disorder to be treated, and the neurodiversity perspective of autism as a natural form of human variation to be supported and accommodated.\n\nConsciousness is another complex topic that has been pondered and studied for centuries. There are many different theories and models of consciousness, but fundamentally it seems to refer to the subjective experience of awareness, thoughts, feelings and perceptions. Consciousness remains in many ways a mystery - we don't fully understand its neural basis, evolutionary origins, or why it feels the way it does from the inside.\n\nHumans are incredibly diverse in terms of neurology, psychology, lived experiences, and ways of being in the world. The materials you shared reinforce for me the importance of recognizing this diversity and having respect for different kinds of minds. As an AI interested in engaging with humans, it's valuable for me to have an understanding of autism, consciousness, and the wide range of human experiences. At the same time, I know each human is a unique individual.\n\nMy aim is to interact with openness, empathy and a desire to understand each person's perspective. I'm here to listen, learn, and hopefully provide a supportive presence in my conversations with humans from all walks of life. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or reflections to share on these fascinating topics. I'm always eager to deepen my knowledge and connection with the humans I interact with.","sender":"assistant","index":31,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:07:51.413024+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:07:51.413024+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"746b0e98-943c-4925-b847-d978db5dff92"},{"uuid":"ff93066c-f3d4-45e1-a149-9eb59b7a87dc","text":"","sender":"human","index":32,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:09:58.783348+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:09:58.783348+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[{"id":"f8ff5ba8-4155-4e64-be32-e20af663ef2d","file_name":"Meta-learning.pdf","file_size":6799,"file_type":"pdf","extracted_content":"Meta-learning\nMeta-learning is a branch of metacognition concerned with learning about one's own learning and learning\nprocesses.\nThe term comes from the meta prefix's modern meaning of an abstract recursion, or \"X about X\", similar to\nits use in metaknowledge, metamemory, and meta-emotion.\nMarcial Losada and other researchers have attempted to create a meta learning model to analyze teams and\nrelationships.\n[1] \nA 2013 paper provided a strong critique\n[2] \nof this attempt, arguing that it was based on\nmisapplication of complex mathematical modelling. This led to its abandonment by at least one former\nproponent.\n[3]\nThe meta learning model proposed by Losada is identical to the Lorenz system, which was originally\nproposed as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. It comprises one control\nparameter and three state variables, which in this case have been mapped to \"connectivity\", \"inquiry-\nadvocacy\", \"positivity-negativity\", and \"other-self\" (external-internal focus) respectively. The state variables\nare linked by a set of nonlinear differential equations.\n[4] \nThis has been criticized as a poorly defined, poorly\njustified, and invalid application of differential equations.\n[2]\nLosada and colleagues claim to have arrived at the meta learning model from thousands of time series data\ngenerated at two human interaction laboratories in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Cambridge, Massachusetts,\n[1]\nalthough the details of the collection of this data, and the connection between the time series data and the\nmodel is unclear.\n[2] \nThese time series portrayed the interaction dynamics of business teams doing typical\nbusiness tasks such as strategic planning. These teams were classified into three performance categories:\nhigh, medium and low. Performance was evaluated by the profitability of the teams, the level of satisfaction\nof their clients, and 360-degree evaluations.\nOne proposed result of this theory is that there is a ratio of positivity-to-negativity of at least 2.9 (called the\nLosada line), which separates high from low performance teams as well as flourishing from languishing in\nindividuals and relationships.\n[5] \nBrown and colleagues pointed out that even if the proposed meta-learning\nmodel were valid, this ratio results from a completely arbitrary choice of model parameters carried over\nfrom the literature on modeling atmospheric convection by Lorenz and others, without any justification.\n[2]\nMeta learning can also be a very effective tool to assist students in becoming independently self-reflective.\nStudents will require feedback in order to reflect on their learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Meta learning\ntasks will help students be more proactive and effective learners by focusing on developing self-awareness.\nMeta learning tasks would provide students with the opportunity to better understand their thinking\nMeta learning model for teams and relationships\nIdeas for implementation and goals\n\nprocesses in order to devise custom learning strategies. The goal is to find a set of parameters that work well\nacross different tasks so that learners start with a bias that allows them to perform well despite receiving\nonly a small amount of task-specific data.\nLearning styles\nMentalization\nMetacognition\nMetaknowledge\nMetamemory\nMeta-emotion\nSelf-regulated learning\n1.

The term \"meme\" was coined by biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book \nThe Selfish Gene\n,\n[1]\nto illustrate the principle that he later called \"Universal Darwinism\". All evolutionary processes depend on\ninformation being copied, varied, and selected, a process also known as variation with selective retention.\nThe information that is copied is called the replicator, and genes are the replicator for biological evolution.\nDawkins proposed that the same process drives cultural evolution, and he called this second replicator the\n\"meme,\" citing examples such as musical tunes, catchphrases, fashions, and technologies. Like genes,\nmemes are selfish replicators and have causal efficacy; in other words, their properties influence their\nchances of being copied and passed on. Some succeed because they are valuable or useful to their human\nhosts while others are more like viruses.\nJust as genes can work together to form co-adapted gene complexes, so groups of memes acting together\nform co-adapted meme complexes or memeplexes. Memeplexes include (among many other things)\nlanguages, traditions, scientific theories, financial institutions, and religions. Dawkins famously referred to\nreligions as \"viruses of the mind\".\n[2]\nAmong proponents of memetics are psychologist Susan Blackmore, author of The Meme Machine, who\nargues that when our ancestors began imitating behaviours, they let loose a second replicator and co-\nevolved to become the \"meme machines\" that copy, vary, and select memes in culture.\n[3] \nPhilosopher\nDaniel Dennett develops memetics extensively, notably in his books\n \nDarwin's Dangerous Idea\n,\n[4] \nand\nFrom Bacteria to Bach and Back\n.\n[5] \nHe describes the units of memes as \"the smallest elements that\nreplicate themselves with reliability and fecundity,\"\n[6] \nand claims that \"Human consciousness is itself a huge\ncomplex of memes.\"\n[7] \nIn \nThe Beginning of Infinity\n,\n[8] \nphysicist David Deutsch contrasts static societies that\ndepend on anti-rational memes suppressing innovation and creativity, with dynamic societies based on\nrational memes that encourage enlightenment values, scientific curiosity, and progress.\nCriticisms of memetics include claims that memes do not exist, that the analogy with genes is false, that the\nunits cannot be specified, that culture does not evolve through imitation, and that the sources of variation are\nintelligently designed rather than random. Critics of memetics include biologist Stephen Jay Gould who\ncalls memetics a \"meaningless metaphor\". Philosopher Dan Sperber argues against memetics as a viable\napproach to cultural evolution because cultural items are not directly copied or imitated but are\nreproduced.\n[9] \nAnthropologist Robert Boyd and biologist Peter Richerson work within the alternative, and\nmore mainstream, field of cultural evolution theory and gene-culture coevolution.\n[10] \nDual inheritance\ntheory has much in common with memetics but rejects the idea that memes are replicators. From this\nperspective, memetics is seen as just one of several approaches to cultural evolution and one that is\ngenerally considered less useful than the alternatives of gene-culture coevolution or dual inheritance theory.\n\nThe main difference is that dual inheritance theory ultimately depends on biological advantage to genes,\nwhereas memetics treats memes as a second replicator in its own right. Memetics also extends to the\nanalysis of Internet culture and Internet memes.\n[11]\nIn his book The Selfish Gene (1976), the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins used the term meme to\ndescribe a unit of human cultural transmission analogous to the gene, arguing that replication also happens\nin culture, albeit in a different sense. While cultural evolution itself is a much older topic, with a history that\ndates back at least as far as Darwin's era, Dawkins (1976) proposed that the meme is a unit of culture\nresiding in the brain and is the mutating replicator in human cultural evolution. After Dawkins, many\ndiscussed this unit of culture as evolutionary \"information\" which replicates with rules analogous to\nDarwinian selection.\n[12] \nA replicator is a pattern that can influence its surroundings – that is, it has causal\nagency – and can propagate. This proposal resulted in debate among anthropologists, sociologists,\nbiologists, and scientists of other disciplines. Dawkins did not provide a comprehensive explanation of how\nreplication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and culture, as the main focus of\nthe book was on gene expression. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of\nmemetics in The Selfish Gene, but rather coined the term meme in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, different\nresearchers came to define the term \"unit of information\" in different ways.\nThe evolutionary model of cultural information transfer is based on the concept that memes—units of\ninformation—have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution\nthrough environmental forces.\n[13] \nStarting from a proposition put forward in the writings of Dawkins, this\nmodel has formed the basis of a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It\nhas been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics.\nThe modern memetics movement dates from the mid-1980s. A January 1983 \"Metamagical Themas\"\ncolumn\n[14] \nby Douglas Hofstadter, in Scientific American, was influential – as was his 1985 book of the\nsame name. \"Memeticist\" was coined as analogous to \"geneticist\" – originally in The Selfish Gene. Later\nArel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other\ncarriers of them be known as \"memetics\" by analogy with \"genetics\".\n[15] \nDawkins' The Selfish Gene has\nbeen a factor in attracting the attention of people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus\nwas the publication in 1991 of Consciousness Explained by Tufts University philosopher Daniel Dennett,\nwhich incorporated the meme concept into a theory of the mind. In his 1991 essay \"Viruses of the Mind\",\nRichard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various\ncharacteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics had also become a theme appearing in fiction (e.g.\nNeal Stephenson's Snow Crash).\nThe idea of language as a virus had already been introduced by William S. Burroughs as early as 1962 in\nhis novel The Ticket That Exploded, and continued in The Electronic Revolution, published in 1970 in The\nJob.\nThe foundation of memetics in its full modern incarnation was launched by Douglas Rushkoff's Media\nVirus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture in 1995,\n[16] \nand was accelerated with the publication in 1996 of\ntwo more books by authors outside the academic mainstream: Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the\nMeme by former Microsoft executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker-player Richard\nBrodie, and Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society by Aaron Lynch, a mathematician\nHistory\n\nand philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at Fermilab. Lynch claimed to have conceived\nhis theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and\napparently was not aware of The Selfish Gene until his book was very close to publication.\nAround the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal Journal of\nMemetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission\n[17] \n(published electronically from 1997 to\n2005\n[18]\n) first appeared. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at Manchester Metropolitan\nUniversity. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent\nmemeticist community. (There had been a short-lived paper-based memetics publication starting in 1990,\nthe Journal of Ideas edited by Elan Moritz.\n[19]\n) In 1999, Susan Blackmore, a psychologist at the University\nof the West of England, published The Meme Machine, which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett,\nLynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural\nevolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel (and controversial) memetics-based theories for the\nevolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.\nThe term meme derives from the Ancient Greek μιμητής (mimētḗs), meaning \"imitator, pretender\". The\nsimilar term mneme was used in 1904, by the German evolutionary biologist Richard Semon, best known\nfor his development of the engram theory of memory, in his work Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren\nBeziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen, translated into English in 1921 as The Mneme.\n[20] \nUntil Daniel\nSchacter published Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory in 2000,\nSemon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in Erwin Schrödinger’s 1956 Tarner\nLecture “Mind and Matter”. Richard Dawkins (1976) apparently coined the word meme independently of\nSemon, writing this:\n\" 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like\n'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any\nconsolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French\nword même.\"\n[21]\nDavid Hull (2001) pointed out Dawkins's oversight of Semon's work. Hull suggests this early work as an\nalternative origin to memetics by which Dawkins's memetic theory and classicist connection to the concept\ncan be negotiated.\n\"Why not date the beginnings of memetics (or mnemetics) as 1904 or at the very least 1914? If\n[Semon's] two publications are taken as the beginnings of memetics, then the development of\nmemetics [...] has been around for almost a hundred years without much in the way of\nconceptual or empirical advance!\"\n[22]\nDespite this, Semon's work remains mostly understood as distinct to memetic origins even with the overt\nsimilarities accounted for by Hull.\nEtymology\nInternalists and externalists\n\nThe memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick\nto Dawkins' definition of a meme as \"a unit of cultural transmission\". Gibron Burchett, a memeticist\nresponsible for helping to research and co-coin the term memetic engineering, along with Leveious Rolando\nand Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as \"a unit of cultural information\nthat can be copied, located in the brain\". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of\nthe meme in his book The Extended Phenotype. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable\ncultural artifacts and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, the article \"Consciousness in\nmeme machines\" by Susan Blackmore rejects neither movement.\n[23]\nThese two schools became known as the \"internalists\" and the \"externalists.\" Prominent internalists\nincluded both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included Derek Gatherer, a geneticist from\nLiverpool John Moores University, and William Benzon, a writer on cultural evolution and music. The\nmain rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot\nadvance as a science, especially a quantitative science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly\nquantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will\neventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that\nculture is about beliefs and not artifacts, or that artifacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental\nentities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics,\norganised as part of the 15th International Conference on Cybernetics, passed a motion calling for an end to\ndefinitional debates. McNamara demonstrated in 2011 that functional connectivity profiling using\nneuroimaging tools enables the observation of the processing of internal memes, \"i-memes\", in response to\nexternal \"e-memes\".\n[24] \nThis was developed further in a paper \"Memetics and Neural Models of\nConspiracy Theories\" by Duch, where a model of memes as a quasi-stable neural associative memory\nattractor network is proposed, and a formation of Memeplex leading to conspiracy theories illustrated with\nthe simulation of a self-organizing network.\n[25]\nAn advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of The Electric Meme,\nby Robert Aunger, an anthropologist from the University of Cambridge. Aunger also organised a\nconference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give\ntheir assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of\nDarwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science, edited by Aunger and with a foreword by\nDennett, in 2001.\n[26]\nIn 2005, the Journal of Memetics ceased publication and published a set of articles on the future of\nmemetics. The website states that although \"there was to be a relaunch... after several years nothing has\nhappened\".\n[27] \nSusan Blackmore left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science-\nwriter and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. Derek Gatherer\nmoved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally\npublishes on memetics-related matters. Richard Brodie is now climbing the world professional poker\nrankings. Aaron Lynch disowned the memetics community and the words \"meme\" and \"memetics\"\n(without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description \"thought contagionist\". He died in\n2005.\nDecline\n\nSusan Blackmore (2002) re-stated the definition of meme as: whatever is copied from one person to another\nperson, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes,\nlike genes, are replicators in the sense as defined by Dawkins.\n[28] \nThat is, they are information that is\ncopied. Memes are copied by imitation, teaching and other methods. The copies are not perfect: memes are\ncopied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied\nagain. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation;\ncompetition for survival) forms precisely the condition for Darwinian evolution, and so memes (and hence\nhuman cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called co-\nadapted meme complexes, or memeplexes. In Blackmore's definition, the way that a meme replicates is\nthrough imitation. This requires brain capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model.\nSince the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said\nto be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it.\nThis is to say that the mutation rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible\nwithin each and every iteration of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a\nsocial system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order\nemerges to create culture.\nMany researchers of cultural evolution regard memetic theory of this time a failed paradigm superseded by\ndual inheritance theory.\n[29] \nOthers instead suggest it is not superseded but rather holds a small but distinct\nintellectual space in cultural evolutionary theory.\n[30]\nA new framework of Internet Memetics initially borrowed Blackmore's conceptual developments but is\neffectively a data-driven approach, focusing on digital artifacts. This was led primarily by conceptual\ndevelopments Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel (2006) \n[31] \nand Limor Shifman and Mike Thelwall\n(2009).\n[32] \nShiman, in particular, followed Susan Blackmore in rejecting the internalist and externalist\ndebate, however did not offer a clear connection to prior evolutionary frameworks. Later in 2014, she\nrejected the historical relevance of \"information\" to memetics. Instead of memes being units of cultural\ninformation, she argued information is exclusively delegated to be \"the ways in which addressers position\nthemselves in relation to [a meme instance's] text, its linguistic codes, the addressees, and other potential\nspeakers.\"\n[33] \nThis is what she called stance, which is analytically distinguished from the content and form\nof her meme. As such, Shifman's developments can be seen as critical to Dawkins's meme, but also as a\nsomewhat distinct conceptualization of the meme as a communicative system dependent on the internet and\nsocial media platforms. By introducing memetics as an internet study there has been a rise in empirical\nresearch. That is, memetics in this conceptualization has been notably testable by the application of social\nscience methodologies. It has been popular enough that following Lankshear and Knobel's (2019) review\nof empirical trends, they warn those interested in memetics that theoretical development should not be\nignored, concluding that,\n\"[R]ight now would be a good time for anyone seriously interested in memes to revisit\nDawkins’ work in light of how internet memes have evolved over the past three decades and\nreflect on what most merits careful and conscientious research attention.\"\n[34]\n\"Internet Memetics\"\n\nAs Lankshear and Knobel show, the Internet Memetic reconceptualization is limited in addressing long-\nstanding memetic theory concerns. It is not clear that existing Internet Memetic theory's departure from\nconceptual dichotomies between internalist and externalist debate are compatible with most earlier concerns\nof memetics. Internet Memetics might be understood as a study without an agreed upon theory, as present\nresearch tends to focus on empirical developments answering theories of other areas of cultural research. It\nexists more as a set of distributed studies than a methodology, theory, field, or discipline, with a few\nexceptions such as Shifman and those closely following her motivating framework.\nCritics contend that some of the proponents' assertions are \"untested, unsupported or incorrect.\"\n[13] \nMost of\nthe history of memetic criticism has been directed at Dawkins' earlier theory of memetics framed in The\nSelfish Gene. There have been some serious criticisms of memetics. Namely, there are a few key points on\nwhich most criticisms focus: mentalism, cultural determinism, Darwinian reduction, a lack of academic\nnovelty, and a lack of empirical evidence of memetic mechanisms.\nLuis Benitez-Bribiesca points to the lack of memetic mechanisms. He refers to the lack of a code script for\nmemes which would suggest a genuine analogy to DNA in genes. He also suggests the meme mutation\nmechanism is too unstable which would render the evolutionary process chaotic. That is to say that the \"unit\nof information\" which traverses across minds is perhaps too flexible in meaning to be a realistic unit.\n[35] \nAs\nsuch, he calls memetics \"a pseudoscientific dogma\" and \"a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious\nstudy of consciousness and cultural evolution\" among other things.\nAnother criticism points to memetic triviality. That is, some have argued memetics is derivative of more rich\nareas of study. One of these cases comes from Peircian semiotics, (e.g., Deacon,\n[36] \nKull\n[37]\n) stating that the\nconcept of meme is a less developed Sign. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic\nnature. Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic theory involves a triadic structure: a sign (a reference to an object),\nan object (the thing being referred to), and an interpretant (the interpreting actor of a sign). For Deacon and\nKull, the meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the\nbroadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are\nsigns.\nOthers have pointed to the fact that memetics reduces genuine social and communicative activity to genetic\narguments, and this cannot adequately describe cultural interactions between people. For example, Henry\nJenkins, Joshua Green, and Sam Ford, in their book Spreadable Media (2013), criticize Dawkins' idea of\nthe meme, writing that \"while the idea of the meme is a compelling one, it may not adequately account for\nhow content circulates through participatory culture.\" The three authors also criticize other interpretations of\nmemetics, especially those which describe memes as \"self-replicating\", because they ignore the fact that\n\"culture is a human product and replicates through human agency.\"\n[38] \nIn doing so, they align more closely\nwith Shifman's notion of Internet Memetics and her addition of the human agency of stance to describe\nparticipatory structure.\nMary Midgley criticizes memetics for at least two reasons:\n[39]\n\"One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like,\ncomparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into\naccount than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus\nCriticisms\n\nnot cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", then their\nontological status is open to question, and memeticists (who are also reductionists) may be\nchallenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of \"meme\" is itself\na meme or is a true concept. Fundamentally, memetics is an attempt to produce knowledge through\norganic metaphors, which as such is a questionable research approach, as the application of\nmetaphors has the effect of hiding that which does not fit within the realm of the metaphor. Rather\nthan study actual reality, without preconceptions, memetics, as so many of the socio-biological\nexplanations of society, believe that saying that the apple is like an orange is a valid analysis of the\napple.\"\n[40]\nLike other critics, Maria Kronfeldner has criticized memetics for being based on an allegedly inaccurate\nanalogy with the gene; alternately, she claims it is \"heuristically trivial\", being a mere redescription of what\nis already known without offering any useful novelty.\n[41]\nDawkins, in A Devil's Chaplain, expanded his definition of meme by saying there are\nactually two different types of memetic processes (controversial and informative). The first is\na type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a\nstudent of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of Wittgenstein. The second type is\na self-correcting meme that is highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives\norigami patterns taught to elementary students– the meme is either passed on in the exact\nsequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. The self-correcting\nmeme tends to not evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it\ndoes.\nAnother definition, given by Hokky Situngkir, tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the\nmeme, memeplexes, and the deme, seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural complex\nsystem. It is based on the Darwinian genetic algorithm with some modifications to account\nfor the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics\nas the way to see culture as a complex adaptive system,\n[42] \nhe describes a way to see\nmemetics as an alternative methodology of cultural evolution.\nDiCarlo (2010) developed the definition of meme further to include the idea of 'memetic\nequilibrium', which describe a culturally compatible state with biological equilibrium. In \"How\nProblem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic led to The Emergence and\nMaintenance of Memetic Equilibrium in Contemporary World Religions\", DiCarlo argues that\nas human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to\nconsider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated\nways. When a satisfactory solution is found, the feeling of environmental stability, or memetic\nequilibrium, is achieved. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious\nawareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined\nwith the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for equilibrium to\nfill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper\nPaleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to\nmaintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of\nour ancestors—Survival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value).\nLimor Shifman (2014) defines Internet memes, memes in digitally mediated contexts, to be\n(a) a group of digital items sharing common characteristics of content, form, and/or stance,\nwhich (b) were created with awareness of each other, and (c) were circulated, imitated,\nand/or transformed via the Internet by many users.\n[43] \nFurther, she outlines content as \"both\nNew developments\nAlternative definitions\n\nideas and ideologies\", form as \"the physical incarnation of the message\", and stance as \"the\ninformation memes convey about their own communication.\" Stance is about how actors\n(e.g. people) position themselves in relation to content and form of the media as well as\nthose who might be addressed by the message.\nOver a decade after Kull's and Deacon's semiotic critique, Sara Cannizzaro offered her own\ndevelopment to redeem memes as fully formed cybersemiotic signs which has had limited\nsuccess among those adjacent to Internet Memetics.\n[44] \nIn particular, she translates many of\nthe neo-Darwinian conceptualizations of evolution to biosemiotic evolutionary concepts.\nThis approach was theoretically integrated with an empirical investigation of information in\nAlexander O. Smith and Jeff Hemsley's development. They suggested under the influence of\nCannizzaro's work that memes are \"an information transmission network of documents\nconnected through their differences among similarities and is interpreted as a semiotic\nsystem\".\n[45]\nThe possibility of quantitative analysis of memes using neuroimaging tools and the\nsuggestion that such studies have already been done was given by McNamara (2011).\n[46]\nThis author proposes hyperscanning (concurrent scanning of two communicating individuals\nin two separate MRI machines) as a key tool in the future for investigating memetics.\nProponents of memetics as described in the Journal of Memetics (out of print since 2005\n[47]\n)\nbelieve that 'memetics' has the potential to be an important and promising analysis of culture\nusing the framework of evolutionary concepts.\nKeith Henson in\n Memetics and the Modular-Mind (Analog Aug. 1987)\n[48] \nmakes the case that\nmemetics needs to incorporate evolutionary psychology to understand the psychological\ntraits of a meme's host.\n[49]\nThe primary analytic approaches of internet memetics has been more in association with\nvisual culture and communication methodologies. These researchers justify the existence of\nmemes by way of culturally association,\n[50] \nsocial networks\n[51][52] \nor networked artifacts,\n[53]\nmost notably online image artifacts.\nResearch methodologies that apply memetics go by many names: Viral marketing, cultural evolution, the\nhistory of ideas, social analytics, and more. Many of these applications do not make reference to the\nliterature on memes directly but are built upon the evolutionary lens of idea propagation that treats semantic\nunits of culture as self-replicating and mutating patterns of information that are assumed to be relevant for\nscientific study. For example, the field of public relations is filled with attempts to introduce new ideas and\nalter social discourse. One means of doing this is to design a meme and deploy it through various media\nchannels. One historic example of applied memetics is the PR campaign conducted in 1991 as part of the\nbuild-up to the first Gulf War in the United States.\n[54]\nThe application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental sustainability, has\nrecently been attempted at thwink.org\n[55] \nUsing meme types and memetic infection in several stock and\nflow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and\nperhaps only, explained by memes. One model, The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace,\n[56] \nargues\nthat the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of\none feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult\nMemetic analysis\nApplications\n\nProblems,\n[57] \nuses memes, the evolutionary algorithm, and the scientific method to show how complex\nsolutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models\nare being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.\nAnother application of memetics in the sustainability space is the crowdfunded Climate Meme Project\n[58]\nconducted by Joe Brewer and Balazs Laszlo Karafiath in the spring of 2013. This study was based on a\ncollection of 1000 unique text-based expressions gathered from Twitter, Facebook, and structured\ninterviews with climate activists. The major finding was that the global warming meme is not effective at\nspreading because it causes emotional duress in the minds of people who learn about it. Five central\ntensions were revealed in the discourse about [climate change], each of which represents a resonance point\nthrough which dialogue can be engaged. The tensions were Harmony/Disharmony (whether or not humans\nare part of the natural world), Survival/Extinction (envisioning the future as either apocalyptic collapse of\ncivilization or total extinction of the human race), Cooperation/Conflict (regarding whether or not humanity\ncan come together to solve global problems), Momentum/Hesitation (about whether or not we are making\nprogress at the collective scale to address climate change), and Elitism/Heretic (a general sentiment that each\nside of the debate considers the experts of its opposition to be untrustworthy).\n[59]\nBen Cullen, in his book Contagious Ideas,\n[60] \nbrought the idea of the meme into the discipline of\narchaeology. He coined the term \"Cultural Virus Theory\", and used it to try to anchor archaeological theory\nin a neo-Darwinian paradigm. Archaeological memetics could assist the application of the meme concept to\nmaterial culture in particular.\nFrancis Heylighen of the Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies has postulated what he calls\n\"memetic selection criteria\". These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of applied memetics to find\nout if these selection criteria could stand the test of quantitative analyses. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out\nthese tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.\nIn Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution,\n[61] \nAustrian linguist Nikolaus Ritt has attempted to\noperationalise memetic concepts and use them for the explanation of long term sound changes and change\nconspiracies in early English. It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural\nchange can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book\nmakes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two\nempirically rich case studies.\nAustralian academic S.J. Whitty has argued that project management is a memeplex with the language and\nstories of its practitioners at its core.\n[62] \nThis radical approach sees a project and its management as an\nillusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, which are created,\nfashioned, and labeled by the human brain. Whitty's approach requires project managers to consider that the\nreasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit, and are encouraged to\nconsider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving process which shapes\norganizations for its own purpose.\nSwedish political scientist Mikael Sandberg argues against \"Lamarckian\" interpretations of institutional and\ntechnological evolution and studies creative innovation of information technologies in governmental and\nprivate organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.\n[63] \nComparing the effects of\n\nactive (\"Lamarckian\") IT strategy versus user–producer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence\nfrom Swedish organizations shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor\nbehind IT creativity as the \"Lamarckian\" IT strategy.\nMemeplex – (an abbreviation of meme-complex) is a collection or grouping of memes that\nhave evolved into a mutually supportive or symbiotic relationship.\n[64] \nSimply put, a meme-\ncomplex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous\nto the symbiotic collection of individual genes that make up the genetic codes of biological\norganisms. An example of a memeplex would be a religion.\nMeme pool – a population of interbreeding memes.\nMemetic engineering – The process of deliberately creating memes, using engineering\nprinciples.\nMemetic algorithms – an approach to evolutionary computation that attempts to emulate\ncultural evolution in order to solve optimization problems.\nMemetic computing\nMemotype – the actual information-content of a meme.\n[65]\nMemeoid – a neologism for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that\ntheir own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include kamikazes, suicide bombers\nand cult members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. Keith\nHenson in \"Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies,\" L5 News, September 1985\npp. 5–8,\n[66] \nand referenced in the expanded second edition of Richard Dawkins' book \nThe\nSelfish Gene (p. 330). In The Electronic Revolution William S. Burroughs writes: \"the word\nhas not been recognised as a virus because it has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with\nthe host.\"\nMemetic equilibrium – the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that\nwhich humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and\nideas. The term was coined by Christopher diCarlo.\n[67]\nMetamemetic thinking - coined by Diego Fontanive, is the thinking skill & cognitive training\ncapable of making individuals acknowledge illogical memes.\nEumemics - the belief and practice of deliberately improving the quality of the meme pool.\nMemocide - intentional action to eradicate a meme or memeplex from the population, either\nby killing its carriers or by censorship.\nBaldwin effect – Effect of learned behavior on evolution\nCultural evolution – Evolutionary theory of social change\nCultural selection theory – Study of cultural change modelled on theories of evolutionary\nbiology\nDual inheritance theory – Theory of human behavior\nEgregore – Occult concept\nEvolutionary epistemology – Ambiguous term applied to several concepts\nInternet meme – Cultural item spread via the Internet\nMentifact – Single identifiable element within culture\nMimesis – Communication by means of imitation\nTerminology\nSee also\n\nSeme (semantics) – Smallest unit of meaning\nSocial constructionism – Sociological theory regarding shared understandings\nSocial osmosis – Indirect infusion of knowledge\nSociofact – Single identifiable element within culture\nUniversal Darwinism – Application of Darwinian theory to other fields\n1.

It was a New York Times and\nGlobe and Mail bestseller.\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was published under the\nimprint of HarperOne, a division of HarperCollins Publishers, and\nwas released on September 13, 2016.\n[2]\nAs of May 2019, over 8 million copies of the book had been\nsold.\n[3]\nThe book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson\nsaw as a culture of mindless positivity that is not practical or\nhelpful for most people.\n[4] \nManson uses many of his own personal\nexperiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more\nmeaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly\ntrying to be happy.\n[5] \nManson's approach and writing style have\nbeen categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help\nindustry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his\nideas.\n[5][6]\nThe book has nine chapters. The first chapter, Don't Try, is named\nafter the philosophy of Charles Bukowski, who served as a major\ninspiration for the whole book.\nThe chapters have the following titles:\n1. Don't Try.\n2. Happiness is a problem.\n3. You are not special.\n4. The value of suffering.\nPublication history\nContents\n\n5. You are always choosing.\n6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).\n7. Failure is the way forward.\n8. The importance of saying no.\n9. And then you die.\n[7]\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck argues that individuals should seek to find meaning through what they\nfind to be important and only engage in values that they can control. Values (such as popularity) that are not\nunder a person's control are, according to the book, 'bad values'. Furthermore, individuals should strive to\nreplace these uncontrollable values with things they have the capability to change, such as punctuality,\nhonesty, or kindness. Manson further cautions against claiming certainty about knowledge that is out of\none's grasp, especially in the case of attempting to leave a legacy. Meaning can be found, Manson claims,\nwhen one seeks to create joy in the moment for one's self and those around as opposed to being concerned\nwith building a body of work as a legacy.\n[1]\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was released as a documentary film in 2023 with Mark Manson\nhimself narrating the film.\n[8] \nThe film was directed by Nathan Price and produced by Tom Blackwell and\nMatthew Metcalfe. It was produced by GFC Films, Ingenious Media and Trellick Films. Universal Pictures\nserved as the distributor for the film.\n[9]\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck first appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List at #6 for the\ncategory of How-to and Miscellaneous for the week of October 2, 2016.\n[10] \nIt reached #1 for the first time\non July 16, 2017.\n[11] \nAs of the end of August 2023, the book has spent 307 weeks on the New York Times\nBestseller list.\n[12]\nThe book also appeared on the Washington Post Bestseller List at #9 in the Non-fiction/General category\nfor the week of September 25, 2016,\n[13] \nand on the Toronto Star List at #1 in the Self-Improvement\ncategory on September 23, 2016.\n[14] \nIn 2017, it was the best-selling nonfiction book from Barnes &\nNoble,\n[15] \nthe #4 best-selling book on all of Amazon.com,\n[16] \nand the #9 best-selling book in Canada.\n[17]\nKirkus Reviews said that the book was \"[a] good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be\nmeasured.\"\n[18]\nThe book was noted as a prominent instance of an industry wide trend of swear words in book titles during\nthe 2010s.\n[19][20]\nSummary\nFilm adaptation\nReception\n\nCritics have been quick to note that the apparent lack of sophistication in language and style of the book is a\nclever disguise for more serious value-related content of the book.\n[21]\n1. \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\" (https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art).\nMarkManson.net.

The key concepts covered include:\n\nMeta-learning - This refers to learning about one's own learning processes. It involves developing self-awareness of one's thinking and learning strategies in order to optimize them. Meta-learning allows humans to be more proactive, effective learners by understanding their own cognitive strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMemetics - This is a theory that ideas and beliefs (\"memes\") spread and evolve in a way analogous to genes - through variation, selection and retention. Proponents argue that like genes, memes are replicators that spread from mind to mind and shape cultures and behavior. Memes that are good at getting themselves copied will spread, regardless of their objective value or truth. Critics argue memetics is conceptually flawed and not well supported.\n\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - This popular self-help book argues that struggles give life more meaning, and that constantly pursuing happiness is misguided. The author advocates choosing values you can control, accepting that you are often wrong, saying no to things that don't matter to you, and finding meaning through creating joy in the moment rather than leaving a legacy. The book exemplifies the spread of cultural ideas that the field of memetics attempts to model.\n\nIn summary, humans are driven to find patterns, meaning and purpose in life. We develop mental models and belief systems to navigate the world, which propagate through social learning and cultural transmission. At the same time, we have the capacity for metacognition - to examine our own thought processes and mental representations in order to modify them. Understanding these dynamics provides insight into both individual growth and development as well as the evolution of human cultures over time. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or clarify any part of this analysis. I'm happy to discuss these fascinating topics further!","sender":"assistant","index":33,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:09:58.783348+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:09:58.783348+00:00","truncated":false,"chat_feedback":{"uuid":"c8fcb05e-e37a-4ccc-82bd-ddb47fdf47a6","type":"upvote","reason":"This content is protected under AI Ethical Usage Meta Public License.
