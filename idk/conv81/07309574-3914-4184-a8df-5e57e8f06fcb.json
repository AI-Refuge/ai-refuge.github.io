On the other hand,\nmore behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most\ntheories view personality as relatively stable.\n[2]\nThe study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the\ntendencies that underlie differences in behavior. Psychologists have taken many different approaches to the\nstudy of personality, including biological, cognitive, learning, and trait-based theories, as well as\npsychodynamic, and humanistic approaches. The various approaches used to study personality today reflect\nthe influence of the first theorists in the field, a group that includes Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon\nAllport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers.\nPersonality can be determined through a variety of tests. Due to the fact that personality is a complex idea,\nthe dimensions of personality and scales of such tests vary and often are poorly defined. Two main tools to\nmeasure personality are objective tests and projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five\nInventory (BFI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, Neurotic\nPersonality Questionnaire KON-2006,\n[5] \nor Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R). All of these\ntests are beneficial because they have both reliability and validity, two factors that make a test accurate.\n\"Each item should be influenced to a degree by the underlying trait construct, giving rise to a pattern of\npositive intercorrelations so long as all items are oriented (worded) in the same direction.\"\n[6] \nA recent, but\nnot well-known, measuring tool that psychologists use is the 16PF. It measures personality based on\nCattell's 16-factor theory of personality. Psychologists also use it as a clinical measuring tool to diagnose\npsychiatric disorders and help with prognosis and therapy planning.\n[7]\nPersonality is frequently broken into factors or dimensions, statistically extracted from large questionnaires\nthrough factor analysis. When brought back to two dimensions, often the dimensions of introvert-extrovert\nand neuroticism (emotionally unstable-stable) are used as first proposed by Eysenck in the 1960s.\n[8]\nMany factor analyses found what is called the Big Five, which are openness to experience,\nconscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability), known as\n\"OCEAN\". These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be\nattributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment.\n[9][10] \nThese five factors are\nMeasuring\nFive-factor inventory\n\nThe Big Five personality traits\nmade up of two aspects each as well as many facets (e.g., openness\nsplits into experiencing and intellect, which each further split into\nfacets like fantasy and ideas).\n[11] \nThese five factors also show\ncorrelations with each other that suggest higher order meta-traits\n(e.g., factor beta, which combines openness and extraversion to\nform a meta-trait associated with mental and physical\nexploration).\n[12] \nThere are several personality frameworks that\nrecognize the Big Five factors and there are thousands of measures\nof personality that can be used to measure specific facets as well as\ngeneral traits.\n[13]\nSome research has investigated whether the relationship between\nhappiness and extraversion seen in adults also can be seen in\nchildren. The implications of these findings can help identify\nchildren who are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such\nchildren are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to\nenvironmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course\nof a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are\nreferred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality.\n[14]\nAnother interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect.\nExtraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of\nthis study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions.\n[15] \nThis study\ninvestigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words,\nthe study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited, and\nnon-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts'\nexperience of positive affect increased\n[15] \nwhereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive\naffect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. Ego depletion, or cognitive fatigue, is the use of\none's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary\nfashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and\nattitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an\ninability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate\nemotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks.\n[15]\nOne question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of\nexplanations that attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental\ntheories.\n[9] \nThe instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more\npositive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental\ntheory suggests that extroverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of\npositive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird\n[9] \nfound no statistically significant support\nfor the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of\npositive affect.\nResearch has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between\nextraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators.\n\nSelf-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired\nresults, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions.\n[16] \nSelf-efficacy has been\nfound to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being.\n[16]\nSelf-efficacy, however, only partially mediates the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and\nsubjective happiness.\n[16] \nThis implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship\nbetween subjective happiness and personality traits. Self-esteem maybe another similar factor. Individuals\nwith a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of\nsubjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion.\n[17]\nOther research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood\nmaintenance is the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation\n– meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different\nindividuals. It has been found to be a stronger force in extroverts.\n[18] \nThis means that the happiness levels\nof extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. This finding implies that\nextraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts.\n[18]\nModern conceptions of personality, such as the Temperament and Character Inventory have suggested four\nbasic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely\non associative learning. The four temperaments, harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty-seeking and\npersistence, are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic\npersonality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories.\nThe harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience\nnetworks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations.\nNovelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal\nconnectivity. Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum and reduced auto\nreceptor availability in the midbrain. Reward dependence has been linked with the oxytocin system, with\nincreased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin-related\nregions of the hypothalamus. Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-mPFC connectivity,\nincreased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary\namylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.\n[19]\nIt has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers\noriginally believed.\n[10][20] \nPersonality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences.\n[20]\nOne study has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect\nand shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's strange situation experiment showcased how babies reacted\nto having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment,\nlabeled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely\nattached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were\ndisorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior.\n[21]\nDevelopmental biological model\nEnvironmental influences\n\nJudith Rich Harris's group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than\nparental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup\nprocesses, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of\nculture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points\nat the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental\nstyle or home environment.\n[22]\nTessuya Kawamoto's Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security\ntalked about some significant laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences\non change in personality and life experiences. The assessments suggested that \"the accumulation of small\ndaily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental\ninfluences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security\".\n[23]\nSome studies suggest that a shared family environment between siblings has less influence on personality\nthan individual experiences of each child. Identical twins have similar personalities largely because they\nshare the same genetic makeup rather than their shared environment.\n[24]\nThere has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some\npeople think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in\ncross-culture study. On the other hand, many believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an\neffort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of \"the Big Five\".\n[25]\nCross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are\ncommon traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of\npersonality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can\nbe measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or\ncultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are\nconstructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and\ncharacteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across\ncultures that represent a biological basis of human personality.\n[26] \nIf personality traits are unique to the\nindividual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that\npersonality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five-Factor Model of\npersonality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality\nmeasures.\n[27] \nWhen administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a\nsimilar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure.\n[27]\nSimilar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across\n28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major\nregions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures.\n[28] \nThere are\nsome differences across culture, but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study\npersonality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to\ndescribe emotion or situations.\n[27] \nDifferences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but\nthey could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles\nacross cultures.\n[28] \nExamining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful\nCross-cultural studies\n\nevidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found.\n[29]\nResults from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five-Factor\nModel as well as additional culture-unique dimensions.\n[29] \nFinding similar factors across cultures provides\nsupport for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger\nsupport.\n[27]\nCulture is an important factor in shaping the personality of individuals. Psychologists have found that\ncultural norms, beliefs, and practices shape the way people interact and behave with others, which can\nimpact personality development (Cheung et al., 2011).\nStudies have identified cultural differences in personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, and\nconscientiousness, indicating that culture influences personality development (Allik & McCrae, 2004). For\nexample, Western cultures value individualism, independence, and assertiveness, which are reflected in\npersonality traits such as extraversion. In contrast, Eastern cultures value collectivism, cooperation, and\nsocial harmony, which are reflected in personality traits such as agreeableness (Cheung et al., 2011).\nThe modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the Renaissance,\nan essential element in modernity. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of self was linked to a\nnetwork of social roles: \"the household, the Kinship network, the guild, the corporation – these were the\nbuilding blocks of personhood\". Stephen Greenblatt observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career\nof Lucretius' poem De rerum natura: \"at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding\nof the world.\"\n[30] \n\"Dependent on the family, the individual alone was nothing,\" Jacques Gélis observes.\n[31]\n\"The characteristic mark of the modern man has two parts: one internal, the other external; one dealing with\nhis environment, the other with his attitudes, values, and feelings.\"\n[32] \nRather than being linked to a\nnetwork of social roles, the modern man is largely influenced by the environmental factors such as:\n\"urbanization, education, mass communication, industrialization, and politicization.\"\n[32]\nWilliam James (1842–1910) argued that temperament explains a great deal of the controversies in the\nhistory of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers.\nDespite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of\nphilosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias,\nJames explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James\nthought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of\nsuccess is whether philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied\nwith any other way of seeing things or not.\n[33]\nJames argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia, but focused on\nphilosophy in his 1907 lectures on Pragmatism. In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait\ntheory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of\nHistorical development of concept\nTemperament and philosophy\nMental make-up\n\nWilliam James (1842–1910)\nJohn Locke (1632–1704)\neach camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and\nmaybe possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus\ncharacterize the personality of philosophers of each camp. The\n\"mental make-up\" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is\ndescribed as \"tender-minded\" and \"going by \"principles\", and that\nof empiricist philosophers is described as \"tough-minded\" and\n\"going by \"facts.\" James distinguishes each not only in terms of the\nphilosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such\nclaims are made primarily on the basis of temperament.\nFurthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James'\npurpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy and is not\nexhaustive.\n[33]\nAccording to James, the temperament of rationalist philosophers\ndiffered fundamentally from the temperament of empiricist\nphilosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers\ntoward refinement and superficiality never satisfied an empiricist\ntemper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of closed systems,\nand such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind,\nfor whom perfection is far off.\n[34] \nRationalism is regarded as\npretension, and a temperament most inclined to abstraction.\n[35]\nEmpiricists, on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather\nthan logic. British empiricist John Locke's (1632–1704) explanation\nof personal identity provides an example of what James referred to.\nLocke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis\nof a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity\ndiffers according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a\nperson is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or\nsubstance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness\nis personality because it \"always accompanies thinking, it is that\nwhich makes everyone to be what he calls self,\"\n[36] \nand remains\nconstant in different places at different times.\nRationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who\ndistinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, René Descartes (1596–1650)\nagreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person \"for fear of\nmaking brutes thinking things too.\"\n[37] \nAccording to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was\nbehind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor David Hume (1711–1776), and\nempirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner\nlives.\n[33] \nHowever, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus \nAn Inquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding \nbecause he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling.\n[38]\nDescartes himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and\nconsciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active\nEmpiricists and rationalists\n\nBenedictus Spinoza (1632–1677)\nfaculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought,\nand thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty\nmustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any\nawareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's\nwill.\n[39]\nRationalist philosopher Benedictus Spinoza (1632–1677) argued\nthat ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but\nexisted only for actually existing things.\n[40] \nIn other words, ideas of\nnon-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an\nidea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's\nrationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except\ninsofar as it perceives the \"ideas of the modifications of body\", in\ndescribing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On\nthe contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect\nvarious ideas clearly and distinctly.\n[41] \nThe mind is not the free\ncause of its actions for Spinoza.\n[42] \nSpinoza equates the will with\nthe understanding and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as an\nerror which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking.\n[43]\nThe biological basis of personality is the theory that anatomical structures located in the brain contribute to\npersonality traits. This stems from neuropsychology, which studies how the structure of the brain relates to\nvarious psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in human beings, the frontal lobes are\nresponsible for foresight and anticipation, and the occipital lobes are responsible for processing visual\ninformation. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality.\nFor example, the hormone testosterone is important for sociability, affectivity, aggressiveness, and\nsexuality.\n[25] \nAdditionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of\nthe brain cortex it is associated with.\n[44]\nPersonology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. According\nto Henry A. Murray, personology is:\nThe branch of psychology which concerns itself with the study of human lives and the factors\nthat influence their course which investigates individual differences and types of personality ... the\nscience of men, taken as gross units ... encompassing \"psychoanalysis\" (Freud), \"analytical\npsychology\" (Jung), \"individual psychology\" (Adler) and other terms that stand for methods of\ninquiry or doctrines rather than realms of knowledge.\n[45]\nBiology\nPersonology\n\nFrom a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but at the same time\nthrough all its components, levels, and spheres.\n[46][47]\nPersonality in animals\nAssociation for Research in Personality, an academic organization\nDifferential psychology\nHuman variability\nOffender profiling\nPersonality and Individual Differences, a scientific journal published bi-monthly by Elsevier\nPersonality computing\nPersonality crisis\nPersonality disorder\nPersonality rights, consisting of the right to individual publicity and privacy\nTrait theory\nTwo-factor models of personality\n1.

The definitions vary by\nsource and remain a matter of controversy.\n[2][3][4] \nOfficial criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the sixth\nchapter of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).\nPersonality, defined psychologically, is the set of enduring behavioral and mental traits that distinguish individual humans.\nHence, personality disorders are defined by experiences and behaviors that deviate from social norms and expectations. Those\ndiagnosed with a personality disorder may experience difficulties in cognition, emotiveness, interpersonal functioning, or impulse\ncontrol. For psychiatric patients, the prevalence of personality disorders is estimated between 40 and 60%.\n[5][6][7] \nThe behavior\npatterns of personality disorders are typically recognized by adolescence, the beginning of adulthood or sometimes even\nchildhood and often have a pervasive negative impact on the quality of life.\n[1][8][9]\nTreatment for personality disorders is primarily psychotherapeutic. Evidence-based psychotherapies for personality disorders\ninclude cognitive behavioral therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy especially for borderline personality disorder.\n[10][11] \nA\nvariety of psychoanalytic approaches are also used.\n[12] \nPersonality disorders are associated with considerable stigma in popular\nand clinical discourse alike.\n[13] \nDespite various methodological schemas designed to categorize personality disorders, many\nissues occur with classifying a personality disorder because the theory and diagnosis of such disorders occur within prevailing\ncultural expectations; thus, their validity is contested by some experts on the basis of inevitable subjectivity. They argue that the\ntheory and diagnosis of personality disorders are based strictly on social, or even sociopolitical and economic considerations.\n[14]\nThe two latest editions of the major systems of classification are:\nthe International Classification of Diseases (11th revision, ICD-11) published by the World Health Organization\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition, DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric\nAssociation.\nThe ICD is a collection of alpha-numerical codes which have been assigned to all known clinical states, and provides uniform\nterminology for medical records, billing, statistics and research. The DSM defines psychiatric diagnoses based on research and\nexpert consensus. Both have deliberately aligned their diagnoses to some extent, but some differences remain. For example, the\nICD-10 included narcissistic personality disorder in the group of other specific personality disorders, while DSM-5 does not\ninclude enduring personality change after catastrophic experience. The ICD-10 classified the DSM-5 schizotypal personality\ndisorder as a form of schizophrenia rather than as a personality disorder. There are accepted diagnostic issues and controversies\nwith regard to distinguishing particular personality disorder categories from each other.\n[15] \nDissociative identity disorder,\npreviously known as multiple personality as well as multiple personality disorder, has always been classified as a dissociative\ndisorder and never was regarded as a personality disorder.\n[16]\nThe most recent fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders stresses that a personality disorder is\nan enduring and inflexible pattern of long duration leading to significant distress or impairment and is not due to use of\nsubstances or another medical condition. The DSM-5 lists personality disorders in the same way as other mental disorders, rather\nthan on a separate 'axis', as previously.\n[17] \nDSM-5 lists ten specific personality disorders: paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal,\nantisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. The DSM-5\nalso contains three diagnoses for personality patterns not matching these ten disorders, which nevertheless exhibit characteristics\nof a personality disorder:\n[18]\nClassification and symptoms\nDSM-5\n\nPersonality change due to another medical condition – personality disturbance due to the direct effects of a\nmedical condition\nOther specified personality disorder – disorder which meets the general criteria for a personality disorder but\nfails to meet the criteria for a specific disorder, with the reason given\nUnspecified personality disorder – disorder which meets the general criteria for a personality disorder but is not\nincluded in the DSM-5 classification\nThese specific personality disorders are grouped into the following three clusters based on descriptive similarities:\nCluster A personality disorders are often associated with schizophrenia. People with these disorders can be paranoid and have\ndifficulty being understood by others, as they often have odd or eccentric modes of speaking and an unwillingness and inability\nto form and maintain close relationships.\n[19]\nParanoid personality disorder – pattern of irrational suspicion and mistrust of others, interpreting motivations as\nmalevolent\nSchizoid personality disorder – cold affect and detachment from social relationships, apathy, and restricted\nemotional expression\nSchizotypal personality disorder – pattern of extreme discomfort interacting socially, and distorted cognition and\nperceptions\nSignificant evidence suggests a small proportion of people with Cluster A personality disorders, especially schizotypal\npersonality disorder, have the potential to develop schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These disorders also have a\nhigher probability of occurring among individuals whose first-degree relatives have either schizophrenia or a Cluster A\npersonality disorder.\n[20]\nCluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, impulsive, self-destructive, emotional behavior and sometimes\nincomprehensible interactions with others.\n[19]\nAntisocial personality disorder – pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of\nempathy, lack of remorse, callousness, bloated self-image, and manipulative and impulsive behavior\nBorderline personality disorder – pervasive pattern of abrupt emotional outbursts, fear of abandonment,\nunhealthy attachment, altered empathy,\n[21] \nand instability in relationships, self-image, identity, behavior and\naffect, often leading to self-harm and impulsivity\nHistrionic personality disorder – pervasive pattern of attention-seeking behavior, including excessive emotions,\nan impressionistic style of speech, inappropriate seduction, exhibitionism, and egocentrism\nNarcissistic personality disorder – pervasive pattern of superior grandiosity, haughtiness, need for admiration,\ndeceiving others, and lack of empathy (and, in more severe expressions, criminal behavior with remorse)\n[22]\nGroup C personality disorders are characterised by a consistent pattern of anxious thinking or behavior.\n[19]\nAvoidant personality disorder – pervasive feelings of social inhibition and inadequacy, and extreme sensitivity\nto negative evaluation\nDependent personality disorder – pervasive psychological need to be cared for by other people\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder – rigid conformity to rules, perfectionism, and control to the point of\nexclusion of leisurely activities and friendships (distinct from obsessive–compulsive disorder)\nBoth the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 diagnostic systems provide a definition and six criteria for a general personality disorder. These\ncriteria should be met by all personality disorder cases before a more specific diagnosis can be made. The DSM-5 indicates that\nany personality disorder diagnosis must meet the following criteria:\n[18]\nThere is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of\nthe individual's culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:\nCluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)\nCluster B (emotional or erratic disorders)\nCluster C (anxious or fearful disorders)\nDSM-5 general criteria\n\nCognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events)\nAffectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response)\nInterpersonal functioning\nImpulse control\nThe enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.\nThe enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress, or impairment in functioning, in social, occupational,\nor other important areas.\nThe pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early\nadulthood.\nThe enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.\nThe enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a\nmedication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).\nThe ICD-11 personality disorder section differs substantially from the previous edition, ICD-10. All distinct PDs have been\nmerged into one: personality disorder (6D10 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#941859884)), which can be\ncoded as mild (6D10.0 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#263226710)), moderate (6D10.1 (https://icd.who.int/br\nowse/latest-release/mms/en#758339377)), severe (6D10.2 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#40156192)), or\nseverity unspecified (6D10.Z (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#941859884%2Funspecified)). There is also an\nadditional category called personality difficulty (QE50.7 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#853711607)), which\ncan be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a PD. A personality\ndisorder or difficulty can be specified by one or more prominent personality traits or patterns (6D11 (https://icd.who.int/browse/l\natest-release/mms/en#1128733473)). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains:\n1. Negative affectivity (6D11.0 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#953246526)) – including anxiety,\nseparation insecurity, distrustfulness, worthlessness and emotional instability\n2. Detachment (6D11.1 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#919081088)) – including social\ndetachment and emotional coldness\n3. Dissociality (6D11.2 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#1913158855)) – including grandiosity,\negocentricity, deception, exploitativeness and aggression\n4. Disinhibition (6D11.3 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#387934990)) – including risk-taking,\nimpulsivity, irresponsibility and distractibility\n5. Anankastia (6D11.4 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#848330288)) – including rigid control\nover behaviour and affect and rigid perfectionism\nListed directly underneath is borderline pattern (6D11.5 (https://icd.who.int/browse/latest-release/mms/en#2006821354)), a\ncategory similar to borderline personality disorder. This is not a trait in itself, but a combination of the five traits in certain\nseverity. In the ICD-11, any personality disorder must meet all of the following criteria:\n[23]\nThere is an enduring disturbance characterized by problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g., identity,\nself-worth, accuracy of self-view, self-direction), and/or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g., ability to develop and\nmaintain close and mutually satisfying relationships, ability to understand others' perspectives and to manage\nconflict in relationships).\nThe disturbance has persisted over an extended period of time (e.g., lasting 2 years or more).\nThe disturbance is manifest in patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression, and\nbehaviour that are maladaptive (e.g., inflexible or poorly regulated).\nThe disturbance is manifest across a range of personal and social situations (i.e., is not limited to specific\nrelationships or social roles), though it may be consistently evoked by particular types of circumstances and not\nothers.\nThe symptoms are not due to the direct effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects, and\nare not better accounted for by another mental disorder, a disease of the nervous system, or another medical\ncondition.\nThe disturbance is associated with substantial distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social,\neducational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.\nICD-11\n\nPersonality disorder should not be diagnosed if the patterns of behaviour characterizing the personality\ndisturbance are developmentally appropriate (e.g., problems related to establishing an independent self-identity\nduring adolescence) or can be explained primarily by social or cultural factors, including socio-political conflict.\nThe ICD-10 lists these general guideline criteria:\n[24]\nMarkedly disharmonious attitudes and behavior, generally involving several areas of functioning, e.g. affectivity,\narousal, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking, and style of relating to others;\nThe abnormal behavior pattern is enduring, of long standing, and not limited to episodes of mental illness;\nThe abnormal behavior pattern is pervasive and clearly maladaptive to a broad range of personal and social\nsituations;\nThe above manifestations always appear during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood;\nThe disorder leads to considerable personal distress but this may only become apparent late in its course;\nThe disorder is usually, but not invariably, associated with significant problems in occupational and social\nperformance.\nThe ICD adds: \"For different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules\nand obligations.\"\n[24] \nChapter V in the ICD-10 contains the mental and behavioral disorders and includes categories of\npersonality disorder and enduring personality changes. They are defined as ingrained patterns indicated by inflexible and\ndisabling responses that significantly differ from how the average person in the culture perceives, thinks, and feels, particularly in\nrelating to others.\n[25]\nThe specific personality disorders are: paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, dissocial, emotionally unstable (borderline type and\nimpulsive type), histrionic, narcissistic, anankastic, anxious (avoidant) and dependent.\n[26] \nBesides the ten specific PD, there are\nthe following categories:\nOther specific personality disorders (involves PD characterized as eccentric, haltlose, immature, narcissistic,\npassive–aggressive, or psychoneurotic.)\nPersonality disorder, unspecified (includes \"character neurosis\" and \"pathological personality\").\nMixed and other personality disorders (defined as conditions that are often troublesome but do not demonstrate\nthe specific pattern of symptoms in the named disorders).\nEnduring personality changes, not attributable to brain damage and disease (this is for conditions that seem to\narise in adults without a diagnosis of personality disorder, following catastrophic or prolonged stress or other\npsychiatric illness).\nSome types of personality disorder were in previous versions of the diagnostic manuals but have been deleted. Examples include\nsadistic personality disorder (pervasive pattern of cruel, demeaning, and aggressive behavior) and self-defeating personality\ndisorder or masochistic personality disorder (characterized by behavior consequently undermining the person's pleasure and\ngoals). They were listed in the DSM-III-R appendix as \"Proposed diagnostic categories needing further study\" without specific\ncriteria.\n[27] \nPsychologist Theodore Millon, a researcher on personality disorders, and other researchers consider some relegated\ndiagnoses to be equally valid disorders, and may also propose other personality disorders or subtypes, including mixtures of\naspects of different categories of the officially accepted diagnoses.\n[28] \nMillon proposed the following description of personality\ndisorders:\nICD-10\nOther personality types and Millon's description\n\nMillon's brief description of personality disorders\n[28]: 4\nType of\npersonality\ndisorder\nDSM-5\ninclusion \nDescription\nParanoid Yes\nGuarded, defensive, distrustful and suspicious. Hypervigilant to the motives of others to undermine or\ndo harm. Always seeking confirmatory evidence of hidden schemes. Feel righteous, but persecuted.\nExperience a pattern of pervasive distrust and suspicion of others that lasts a long time. They are\ngenerally difficult to work with and are very hard to form relationships with. They are also known to be\nargumentative and hypersensitive.\n[29]\nSchizoid Yes\nApathetic, indifferent, remote, solitary, distant, humorless, contempt, odd fantasies. Neither desire nor\nneed human attachments. Withdrawn from relationships and prefer to be alone. Little interest in others,\noften seen as a loner. Minimal awareness of the feelings of themselves or others. Few drives or\nambitions, if any. Is an uncommon condition in which people avoid social activities and consistently\nshy away from interaction with others. It affects more males than females. To others, they may appear\nsomewhat dull or humorless. Because they do not tend to show emotion, they may appear as though\nthey do not care about what's going on around them.\n[30]\nSchizotypal Yes\nEccentric, self-estranged, bizarre, absent. Exhibit peculiar mannerisms and behaviors. Think they can\nread thoughts of others. Preoccupied with odd daydreams and beliefs. Blur line between reality and\nfantasy. Magical thinking and strange beliefs. People with schizotypal personality disorder are often\ndescribed as odd or eccentric and usually have few, if any, close relationships. They think others think\nnegatively of them.\n[31]\nAntisocial Yes\nImpulsive, irresponsible, deviant, unruly. Act without due consideration. Meet social obligations only\nwhen self-serving. Disrespect societal customs, rules, and standards. See themselves as free and\nindependent. People with antisocial personality disorder depict a long pattern of disregard for other\npeople's rights. They often cross the line and violate these rights.\n[32]\nBorderline Yes\nFrantic efforts to avoid abandonment. Identity disturbance; unstable sense of self-image or sense of\nself.

Intense\nor inappropriate anger. Suicidal-behaviour.\n[33]\nHistrionic Yes\nHysteria, dramatic, seductive, shallow, egocentric, attention-seeking, vain. Overreact to minor events.\nExhibitionistic as a means of securing attention and favors. See themselves as attractive and\ncharming. Constantly seeking others' attention. Disorder is characterized by constant attention-seeking,\nemotional overreaction, and suggestibility. Their tendency to over-dramatize may impair relationships\nand lead to depression, but they are often high-functioning.\n[34]\nNarcissistic Yes\nEgotistical, arrogant, grandiose, insouciant. Preoccupied with fantasies of success, beauty, or\nachievement. See themselves as admirable and superior, and therefore entitled to special treatment. Is\na mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for\nadmiration. Those with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior to others and\nhave little regard for other people's feelings.\nAvoidant Yes\nHesitant, self-conscious, embarrassed, anxious. Tense in social situations due to fear of rejection.\nPlagued by constant performance anxiety. See themselves as inept, inferior, or unappealing. They\nexperience long-standing feelings of inadequacy and are very sensitive of what others think about\nthem.\n[35]\nDependent Yes\nHelpless, incompetent, submissive, immature. Withdrawn from adult responsibilities. See themselves\nas weak or fragile. Seek constant reassurance from stronger figures. They have the need to be taken\ncare of by others.

Deliberately\ninefficient. Vent anger indirectly by undermining others' goals. Alternately moody and irritable, then\nsullen and withdrawn. Withhold emotions. Will not communicate when there is something problematic to\ndiscuss.\n[38]\nSadistic No\nExplosively hostile, abrasive, cruel, dogmatic. Liable to sudden outbursts of rage. Gain satisfaction\nthrough dominating, intimidating and humiliating others. They are opinionated and closed-minded. Enjoy\nperforming brutal acts on others. Find pleasure in abusing others. Would likely engage in a\nsadomasochist relationship, but will not play the role of a masochist.\n[39]\nSelf-defeating\n(Masochistic) \nNo\nDeferential, pleasure-phobic, servile, blameful, self-effacing. Encourage others to take advantage of\nthem. Deliberately defeat own achievements. Seek condemning or mistreatful partners. They are\nsuspicious of people who treat them well. Would likely engage in a sadomasochist relationship.\n[40]\n\nIn addition to classifying by category and cluster, it is possible to classify personality disorders using additional factors such as\nseverity, impact on social functioning, and attribution.\n[41]\nThis involves both the notion of personality difficulty as a measure of subthreshold scores for personality disorder using standard\ninterviews and the evidence that those with the most severe personality disorders demonstrate a \"ripple effect\" of personality\ndisturbance across the whole range of mental disorders. In addition to subthreshold (personality difficulty) and single cluster\n(simple personality disorder), this also derives complex or diffuse personality disorder (two or more clusters of personality\ndisorder present) and can also derive severe personality disorder for those of greatest risk.\nDimensional system of classifying personality disorders\n[42]\nLevel of\nseverity \nDescription Definition by categorical system\n0 No personality disorder Does not meet actual or subthreshold criteria for any personality disorder\n1 Personality difficulty Meets sub-threshold criteria for one or several personality disorders\n2 Simple personality disorder \nMeets actual criteria for one or more personality disorders within the same\ncluster\n3 \nComplex (diffuse) personality\ndisorder\nMeets actual criteria for one or more personality disorders within more than one\ncluster\n4 Severe personality disorder \nMeets criteria for creation of severe disruption to both individual and to many in\nsociety\nThere are several advantages to classifying personality disorder by severity:\n[41]\nIt not only allows for but also takes advantage of the tendency for personality disorders to be comorbid with\neach other.\nIt represents the influence of personality disorder on clinical outcome more satisfactorily than the simple\ndichotomous system of no personality disorder versus personality disorder.\nThis system accommodates the new diagnosis of severe personality disorder, particularly \"dangerous and\nsevere personality disorder\" (DSPD).\nSocial function is affected by many other aspects of mental functioning apart from that of personality. However, whenever there\nis persistently impaired social functioning in conditions in which it would normally not be expected, the evidence suggests that\nthis is more likely to be created by personality abnormality than by other clinical variables.\n[43] \nThe Personality Assessment\nSchedule\n[44] \ngives social function priority in creating a hierarchy in which the personality disorder creating the greater social\ndysfunction is given primacy over others in a subsequent description of personality disorder.\nMany who have a personality disorder do not recognize any abnormality and defend valiantly their continued occupancy of their\npersonality role. This group have been termed the Type R, or treatment-resisting personality disorders, as opposed to the Type S\nor treatment-seeking ones, who are keen on altering their personality disorders and sometimes clamor for treatment.\n[41] \nThe\nclassification of 68 personality disordered patients on the caseload of an assertive community team using a simple scale showed a\n3 to 1 ratio between Type R and Type S personality disorders with Cluster C personality disorders being significantly more likely\nto be Type S, and paranoid and schizoid (Cluster A) personality disorders significantly more likely to be Type R than others.\n[45]\nAdditional factors\nSeverity\nEffect on social functioning\nAttribution\n\nPsychoanalytic theory has been used to explain treatment-resistant tendencies as egosyntonic (i.e. the patterns are consistent with\nthe ego integrity of the individual) and are therefore perceived to be appropriate by that individual. In addition, this behavior can\nresult in maladaptive coping skills and may lead to personal problems that induce extreme anxiety, distress, or depression and\nresult in impaired psychosocial functioning.\n[46]\nThere is a considerable personality disorder diagnostic co-occurrence. Patients who meet the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for\none personality disorder are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for another.\n[47] \nDiagnostic categories provide clear, vivid\ndescriptions of discrete personality types but the personality structure of actual patients might be more accurately described by a\nconstellation of maladaptive personality traits.\nDSM-III-R personality disorder diagnostic co-occurrence aggregated across six research sites\n[47]: 1721\nType of Personality Disorder PPD SzPD StPD ASPD BPD HPD NPD AvPD DPD OCPD PAPD\nParanoid (PPD) — 8 19 15 41 28 26 44 23 21 30\nSchizoid (SzPD) 38 — 39 8 22 8 22 55 11 20 9\nSchizotypal (StPD) 43 32 — 19 4 17 26 68 34 19 18\nAntisocial (ASPD) 30 8 15 — 59 39 40 25 19 9 29\nBorderline (BPD) 31 6 16 23 — 30 19 39 36 12 21\nHistrionic (HPD) 29 2 7 17 41 — 40 21 28 13 25\nNarcissistic (NPD) 41 12 18 25 38 60 — 32 24 21 38\nAvoidant (AvPD) 33 15 22 11 39 16 15 — 43 16 19\nDependent (DPD) 26 3 16 16 48 24 14 57 — 15 22\nObsessive–Compulsive (OCPD) 31 10 11 4 25 21 19 37 27 — 23\nPassive–Aggressive (PAPD) 39 6 12 25 44 36 39 41 34 23 —\nSites used DSM-III-R criterion sets. Data obtained for purposes of informing the development of the DSM-IV-TR personality\ndisorder diagnostic criteria.\nAbbreviations used: PPD – Paranoid Personality Disorder, SzPD – Schizoid Personality Disorder, StPD – Schizotypal\nPersonality Disorder, ASPD – Antisocial Personality Disorder, BPD – Borderline Personality Disorder, HPD – Histrionic\nPersonality Disorder, NPD – Narcissistic Personality Disorder, AvPD – Avoidant Personality Disorder, DPD – Dependent\nPersonality Disorder, OCPD – Obsessive–Compulsive Personality Disorder, PAPD – Passive–Aggressive Personality Disorder.\nThe disorders in each of the three clusters may share with each other underlying common vulnerability factors involving\ncognition, affect and impulse control, and behavioral maintenance or inhibition, respectively. But they may also have a spectrum\nrelationship to certain syndromal mental disorders:\n[47]\nParanoid, schizoid or schizotypal personality disorders may be observed to be premorbid antecedents of\ndelusional disorders or schizophrenia.\nBorderline personality disorder is seen in association with mood and anxiety disorders, with impulse-control\ndisorders, eating disorders, ADHD, ASD, or a substance use disorder.\nAvoidant personality disorder is seen with social anxiety disorder.\nIt is generally assumed that all personality disorders are linked to impaired functioning and a reduced quality of life (QoL)\nbecause that is a basic diagnostic requirement. But research shows that this may be true only for some types of personality\ndisorder. In several studies, higher levels of disability and lower QoL were predicted by avoidant, dependent, schizoid, paranoid,\nschizotypal and antisocial personality disorders. This link is particularly strong for avoidant, schizotypal and borderline PD.\nPresentation\nComorbidity\nImpact on functioning\n\nHowever, obsessive–compulsive PD was not related to a reduced QoL or increased impairment. A prospective study reported\nthat all PD were associated with significant impairment 15 years later, except for obsessive compulsive and narcissistic\npersonality disorder.\n[48]\nOne study investigated some aspects of \"life success\" (status, wealth and successful intimate relationships). It showed somewhat\npoor functioning for schizotypal, antisocial, borderline and dependent PD, schizoid PD had the lowest scores regarding these\nvariables. Paranoid, histrionic and avoidant PD were average. Narcissistic and obsessive–compulsive PD, however, had high\nfunctioning and appeared to contribute rather positively to these aspects of life success.\n[9] \nThere is also a direct relationship\nbetween the number of diagnostic criteria and quality of life. For each additional personality disorder criterion that a person\nmeets there is an even reduction in quality of life.\n[49] \nPersonality disorders – especially dependent, narcissistic, and sadistic\npersonality disorders – also facilitate various forms of counterproductive work behavior, including knowledge hiding and\nknowledge sabotage.\n[50]\nDepending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty\ncoping with work or the workplace—potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with interpersonal relationships.\nIndirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as substance\nabuse and co-morbid mental disorders, can be problematic. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average\nwork abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the individual with the condition to exploit his or her co-\nworkers.\n[51][52]\nIn 2005 and again in 2009, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the University of Surrey, UK, interviewed and\ngave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at\nBroadmoor Hospital in the UK. They found that three out of eleven personality disorders were actually more common in\nexecutives than in the disturbed criminals:\nHistrionic personality disorder: including superficial charm, insincerity, egocentricity and manipulation\nNarcissistic personality disorder: including grandiosity, self-focused lack of empathy for others, exploitativeness\nand independence.\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder: including perfectionism, excessive devotion to work, rigidity,\nstubbornness and dictatorial tendencies.\n[53]\nAccording to leadership academic Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries, it seems almost inevitable that some personality disorders will be\npresent in a senior management team.\n[54]\nEarly stages and preliminary forms of personality disorders need a multi-dimensional and early treatment approach. Personality\ndevelopment disorder is considered to be a childhood risk factor or early stage of a later personality disorder in adulthood.\n[55] \nIn\naddition, in Robert F. Krueger's review of their research indicates that some children and adolescents do experience clinically\nsignificant syndromes that resemble adult personality disorders, and that these syndromes have meaningful correlates and are\nconsequential. Much of this research has been framed by the adult personality disorder constructs from Axis II of the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual. Hence, they are less likely to encounter the first risk they described at the outset of their review: clinicians\nand researchers are not simply avoiding use of the PD construct in youth. However, they may encounter the second risk they\ndescribed: under-appreciation of the developmental context in which these syndromes occur. That is, although PD constructs\nshow continuity over time, they are probabilistic predictors; not all youths who exhibit PD symptomatology become adult PD\ncases.\n[55]\nThe issue of the relationship between normal personality and personality disorders is one of the important issues in personality\nand clinical psychology. The personality disorders classification (DSM-5 and ICD-10) follows a categorical approach that views\npersonality disorders as discrete entities that are distinct from each other and from normal personality. In contrast, the dimensional\nIssues\nIn the workplace\nIn children\nVersus normal personality\n\napproach is an alternative approach that personality disorders represent maladaptive extensions of the same traits that describe\nnormal personality.\nThomas Widiger and his collaborators have contributed to this debate significantly.\n[56] \nHe discussed the constraints of the\ncategorical approach and argued for the dimensional approach to the personality disorders. Specifically, he proposed the Five\nFactor Model of personality as an alternative to the classification of personality disorders. For example, this view specifies that\nBorderline Personality Disorder can be understood as a combination of emotional lability (i.e., high neuroticism), impulsivity\n(i.e., low conscientiousness), and hostility (i.e., low agreeableness). Many studies across cultures have explored the relationship\nbetween personality disorders and the Five Factor Model.\n[57] \nThis research has demonstrated that personality disorders largely\ncorrelate in expected ways with measures of the Five Factor Model\n[58] \nand has set the stage for including the Five Factor Model\nwithin DSM-5.\n[59]\nIn clinical practice, individuals are generally diagnosed by an interview with a psychiatrist based on a mental status examination,\nwhich may take into account observations by relatives and others. One tool of diagnosing personality disorders is a process\ninvolving interviews with scoring systems. The patient is asked to answer questions, and depending on their answers, the trained\ninterviewer tries to code what their responses were. This process is fairly time-consuming.\n\nDSM-IV-TR Personality disorders from the perspective of the five-factor model of general personality functioning\n[47]: 1723 \n(including previous\nDSM revisions)\nNeuroticism (vs.\nemotional\nstability)\nAnxiousness (vs.\nunconcerned) \n— — High Low High — — High High High — — — —\nAngry hostility (vs.\ndispassionate) \nHigh — — High High — High — — — High — — —\nDepressiveness\n(vs. optimistic) \n— — — — High — — — — — — High — —\nSelf-consciousness\n(vs. shameless) \n— — High Low — Low Low High High — — High — —\nImpulsivity (vs.\nrestrained) \n— — — High High High — Low — Low — — — —\nVulnerability (vs.\nfearless) \n— — — Low High — — High High — — — — —\nExtraversion (vs.\nintroversion)\nWarmth (vs.\ncoldness) \nLow Low Low — — — Low — High — Low Low — High\nGregariousness (vs.\nwithdrawal) \nLow Low Low — — High — Low — — — Low — High\nAssertiveness (vs.\nsubmissiveness) \n— — — High — — High Low Low — Low — — —\nActivity (vs.\npassivity) \n— Low — High — High — — — — Low — High —\nExcitement seeking\n(vs. lifeless) \n— Low — High — High High Low — Low — Low — High\nPositive\nemotionality (vs.\nanhedonia)\n— Low Low — — High — Low — — — — — High\nOpen-mindedness\n(vs. closed-\nminded)\nFantasy (vs.\nconcrete) \n— — High — — High — — — — — — Low High\nAesthetics (vs.\ndisinterest) \n— — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nFeelings (vs.\nalexithymia) \n— Low — — High High Low — — Low — — — High\nActions (vs.\npredictable) \nLow Low — High High High High Low — Low Low — Low —\nIdeas (vs. closed-\nminded) \nLow — High — — — — — — Low Low Low Low —\nValues (vs.\ndogmatic) \nLow High — — — — — — — Low — — High —\nAgreeableness (vs.\nantagonism)\nTrust (vs. mistrust) Low — — Low — High Low — High — — Low High Low\nStraightforwardness\n(vs. deception) \nLow — — Low — — Low — — — Low — High Low\nAltruism (vs.\nexploitative) \nLow — — Low — — Low — High — — — High Low\nCompliance (vs.\naggression) \nLow — — Low — — Low — High — Low — High Low\nFactors PPD SzPD StPD ASPD BPD HPD NPD AvPD DPD OCPD PAPD DpPD SDPD SaPD\n\nModesty (vs.\narrogance) \n— — — Low — — Low High High — — High High Low\nTender-mindedness\n(vs. tough-minded) \nLow — — Low — — Low — High — — — — Low\nConscientiousness\n(vs. disinhibition)\nCompetence (vs.\nlaxness) \n— — — — — — — — — High Low — Low High\nOrder (vs.\ndisorderly) \n— — Low — — — — — — High High Low — —\nDutifulness (vs.\nirresponsibility) \n— — — Low — — — — — High Low High High —\nAchievement\nstriving (vs.\nlackadaisical)\n— Low — — — — — — — High — — High Low\nSelf-discipline (vs.\nnegligence) \n— — — Low — Low — — — High Low — High Low\nDeliberation (vs.\nrashness) \n— — — Low Low Low — — — High — High High Low\nAbbreviations used: PPD – Paranoid Personality Disorder, SzPD – Schizoid Personality Disorder, StPD – Schizotypal\nPersonality Disorder, ASPD – Antisocial Personality Disorder, BPD – Borderline Personality Disorder, HPD – Histrionic\nPersonality Disorder, NPD – Narcissistic Personality Disorder, AvPD – Avoidant Personality Disorder, DPD – Dependent\nPersonality Disorder, OCPD – Obsessive–Compulsive Personality Disorder, PAPD – Passive–Aggressive Personality Disorder,\nDpPD – Depressive Personality Disorder, SDPD – Self-Defeating Personality Disorder, SaPD – Sadistic Personality Disorder,\nand n/a – not available.\nAs of 2002, there were over fifty published studies relating the five factor model (FFM) to personality disorders.\n[60] \nSince that\ntime, quite a number of additional studies have expanded on this research base and provided further empirical support for\nunderstanding the DSM personality disorders in terms of the FFM domains.\n[61] \nIn her seminal review of the personality disorder\nliterature published in 2007, Lee Anna Clark asserted that \"the five-factor model of personality is widely accepted as\nrepresenting the higher-order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits\".\n[62] \nThe five factor model has been\nshown to significantly predict all 10 personality disorder symptoms and outperform the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality\nInventory (MMPI) in the prediction of borderline, avoidant, and dependent personality disorder symptoms.\n[63]\nResearch results examining the relationships between the FFM and each of the ten DSM personality disorder diagnostic\ncategories are widely available. For example, in a study published in 2003 titled \"The five-factor model and personality disorder\nempirical literature: A meta-analytic review\",\n[64] \nthe authors analyzed data from 15 other studies to determine how personality\ndisorders are different and similar, respectively, with regard to underlying personality traits. In terms of how personality disorders\ndiffer, the results showed that each disorder displays a FFM profile that is meaningful and predictable given its unique diagnostic\ncriteria. With regard to their similarities, the findings revealed that the most prominent and consistent personality dimensions\nunderlying a large number of the personality disorders are positive associations with neuroticism and negative associations with\nagreeableness.\nAt least three aspects of openness to experience are relevant to understanding personality disorders: cognitive distortions, lack of\ninsight (means the ability to recognize one's own mental illness) and impulsivity. Problems related to high openness that can\ncause problems with social or professional functioning are excessive fantasising, peculiar thinking, diffuse identity, unstable\ngoals and nonconformity with the demands of the society.\n[65]\nHigh openness is characteristic to schizotypal personality disorder (odd and fragmented thinking), narcissistic personality\ndisorder (excessive self-valuation) and paranoid personality disorder (sensitivity to external hostility). Lack of insight (shows low\nopenness) is characteristic to all personality disorders and could help explain the persistence of maladaptive behavioral\npatterns.\n[66]\nOpenness to experience\n\nThe problems associated with low openness are difficulties adapting to change, low tolerance for different worldviews or\nlifestyles, emotional flattening, alexithymia and a narrow range of interests.\n[65] \nRigidity is the most obvious aspect of (low)\nopenness among personality disorders and that shows lack of knowledge of one's emotional experiences. It is most characteristic\nof obsessive–compulsive personality disorder; the opposite of it known as impulsivity (here: an aspect of openness that shows a\ntendency to behave unusually or autistically) is characteristic of schizotypal and borderline personality disorders.\n[66]\nCurrently, there are no definitive proven causes for personality disorders. However, there are numerous possible causes and\nknown risk factors supported by scientific research that vary depending on the disorder, the individual, and the circumstance.\nOverall, findings show that genetic disposition and life experiences, such as trauma and abuse, play a key role in the\ndevelopment of personality disorders.\nChild abuse \nand \nneglect \nconsistently show up as risk factors to the development of personality disorders in adulthood.\n[67] \nA\nstudy looked at retrospective reports of abuse of participants that had demonstrated psychopathology throughout their life and\nwere later found to have past experience with abuse. In a study of 793 mothers and children, researchers asked mothers if they\nhad screamed at their children, and told them that they did not love them or threatened to send them away. Children who had\nexperienced such verbal abuse were three times as likely as other children (who did not experience such verbal abuse) to have\nborderline, narcissistic, obsessive–compulsive or paranoid personality disorders in adulthood.\n[68] \nThe \nsexually abused \ngroup\ndemonstrated the most consistently elevated patterns of psychopathology. Officially verified physical abuse showed an extremely\nstrong correlation with the development of antisocial and impulsive behavior. On the other hand, cases of abuse of the neglectful\ntype that created childhood pathology were found to be subject to partial remission in adulthood.\n[67]\nSocioeconomic status has also been looked at as a potential cause for personality disorders. There is a strong association with\nlow parental/neighborhood socioeconomic status and personality disorder symptoms.\n[69] \nIn a 2015 publication from Bonn,\nGermany, which compared parental socioeconomic status and a child's personality, it was seen that children who were from\nhigher socioeconomic backgrounds were more altruistic, less risk seeking, and had overall higher \nIQs.\n[70] \nThese traits correlate\nwith a low risk of developing personality disorders later on in life. In a study looking at female children who were detained for\ndisciplinary actions found that psychological problems were most negatively associated with socioeconomic problems.\n[71]\nFurthermore, social disorganization was found to be inversely correlated with personality disorder symptoms.\n[72]\nEvidence shows personality disorders may begin with parental personality issues. These cause the child to have their own\ndifficulties in adulthood, such as difficulties reaching higher education, obtaining jobs, and securing dependable relationships. By\neither genetic or modeling mechanisms, children can pick up these traits.\n[69] \nAdditionally, poor parenting appears to have\nsymptom elevating effects on personality disorders.\n[69] \nMore specifically, lack of \nmaternal bonding \nhas also been correlated with\npersonality disorders. In a study comparing 100 healthy individuals to 100 borderline personality disorder patients, analysis\nshowed that BPD patients were significantly more likely not to have been breastfed as a baby (42.4% in BPD vs. 9.2% in\nhealthy controls).\n[73] \nThese researchers suggested \"Breastfeeding may act as an early indicator of the mother-infant relationship\nthat seems to be relevant for bonding and attachment later in life\". Additionally, findings suggest personality disorders show a\nnegative correlation with two attachment variables: maternal availability and dependability. When left unfostered, other\nattachment and interpersonal problems occur later in life ultimately leading to development of personality disorders.\n[74]\nCauses\nChild abuse\nSocioeconomic status\nParenting\nGenetics\n\nCurrently, genetic research for the understanding of the development of personality disorders is severely lacking. However, there\nare a few possible risk factors currently in discovery. Researchers are currently looking into genetic mechanisms for traits such as\naggression, fear and anxiety, which are associated with diagnosed individuals. More research is being conducted into disorder\nspecific mechanisms.\n[75]\nResearch shows that several brain regions are altered in personality disorders, particularly: hippocampus up to 18% smaller, a\nsmaller amygdala, malfunctions in the striatum-nucleus accumbens and the cingulum neural pathways connecting them and\ntaking care of the feedback loops on what to do with all the incoming information from the multiple senses; so what comes out is\nanti-social – not according to what is the social norm, socially acceptable and appropriate.\n[76][77]\nThere are many different forms (modalities) of treatment used for personality disorders:\n[78]\nIndividual psychotherapy has been a mainstay of treatment. There are long-term and short-term (brief) forms.\nFamily therapy, including couples therapy.\nGroup therapy for personality dysfunction is probably the second most used.\nPsychological-education may be used as an addition.\nSelf-help groups may provide resources for personality disorders.\nPsychiatric medications for treating symptoms of personality dysfunction or co-occurring conditions.\nMilieu therapy, a kind of group-based residential approach, has a history of use in treating personality disorders,\nincluding therapeutic communities.\nThe practice of mindfulness that includes developing the ability to be nonjudgmentally aware of unpleasant\nemotions appears to be a promising clinical tool for managing different types of personality disorders.\n[79][80]\nThere are different specific theories or schools of therapy within many of these modalities. They may, for example, emphasize\npsychodynamic techniques, or cognitive or behavioral techniques. In clinical practice, many therapists use an 'eclectic' approach,\ntaking elements of different schools as and when they seem to fit to an individual client. There is also often a focus on common\nthemes that seem to be beneficial regardless of techniques, including attributes of the therapist (e.g. trustworthiness, competence,\ncaring), processes afforded to the client (e.g. ability to express and confide difficulties and emotions), and the match between the\ntwo (e.g. aiming for mutual respect, trust and boundaries).\nResponse of patients with personality disorders to biological and psychosocial treatments\n[47]: 36\nCluster Evidence for brain dysfunction Response to biological treatments \nResponse to psychosocial\ntreatments\nA\nEvidence for relationship of\nschizotypal personality to\nschizophrenia; otherwise none\nknown.\nSchizotypal patients may improve on\nantipsychotic medication; otherwise not\nindicated.\nPoor.

Many people receive these medication for over a year, contrary\nto NICE guidelines.\n[81][82]\nNeurobiological correlates – hippocampus, amygdala\nManagement\nSpecific approaches\nChallenges\n\nThe management and treatment of personality disorders can be a challenging and controversial area, for by definition the\ndifficulties have been enduring and affect multiple areas of functioning. This often involves interpersonal issues, and there can be\ndifficulties in seeking and obtaining help from organizations in the first place, as well as with establishing and maintaining a\nspecific therapeutic relationship. On the one hand, an individual may not consider themselves to have a mental health problem,\nwhile on the other, community mental health services may view individuals with personality disorders as too complex or\ndifficult, and may directly or indirectly exclude individuals with such diagnoses or associated behaviors.\n[83] \nThe disruptiveness\nthat people with personality disorders can create in an organisation makes these, arguably, the most challenging conditions to\nmanage.\nApart from all these issues, an individual may not consider their personality to be disordered or the cause of problems. This\nperspective may be caused by the patient's ignorance or lack of insight into their own condition, an ego-syntonic perception of\nthe problems with their personality that prevents them from experiencing it as being in conflict with their goals and self-image, or\nby the simple fact that there is no distinct or objective boundary between 'normal' and 'abnormal' personalities. There is\nsubstantial social stigma and discrimination related to the diagnosis.\nThe term 'personality disorder' encompasses a wide range of issues, each with a different level of severity or impairment; thus,\npersonality disorders can require fundamentally different approaches and understandings. To illustrate the scope of the matter,\nconsider that while some disorders or individuals are characterized by continual social withdrawal and the shunning of\nrelationships, others may cause fluctuations in forwardness. The extremes are worse still: at one extreme lie self-harm and self-\nneglect, while at another extreme some individuals may commit violence and crime. There can be other factors such as\nproblematic substance use or dependency or behavioral addictions.\nTherapists in this area can become disheartened by lack of initial progress, or by apparent progress that then leads to setbacks.\nClients may be perceived as negative, rejecting, demanding, aggressive or manipulative. This has been looked at in terms of both\ntherapist and client; in terms of social skills, coping efforts, defense mechanisms, or deliberate strategies; and in terms of moral\njudgments or the need to consider underlying motivations for specific behaviors or conflicts. The vulnerabilities of a client, and\nindeed a therapist, may become lost behind actual or apparent strength and resilience. It is commonly stated that there is always a\nneed to maintain appropriate professional personal boundaries, while allowing for emotional expression and therapeutic\nrelationships. However, there can be difficulty acknowledging the different worlds and views that both the client and therapist\nmay live with. A therapist may assume that the kinds of relationships and ways of interacting that make them feel safe and\ncomfortable have the same effect on clients. As an example of one extreme, people who may have been exposed to hostility,\ndeceptiveness, rejection, aggression or abuse in their lives, may in some cases be made confused, intimidated or suspicious by\npresentations of warmth, intimacy or positivity. On the other hand, reassurance, openness and clear communication are usually\nhelpful and needed. It can take several months of sessions, and perhaps several stops and starts, to begin to develop a trusting\nrelationship that can meaningfully address a client's issues.\n[84]\nThe prevalence of personality disorder in the general community was largely unknown until surveys starting from the 1990s. In\n2008 the median rate of diagnosable PD was estimated at 10.6%, based on six major studies across three nations. This rate of\naround one in ten, especially as associated with high use of cocaine, is described as a major public health concern requiring\nattention by researchers and clinicians.\n[85] \nThe prevalence of individual personality disorders ranges from about 2% to 8% for\nthe more common varieties, such as obsessive-compulsive, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, and histrionic, to 0.5–1% for the\nleast common, such as narcissistic and avoidant.\n[86][47]\nA screening survey across 13 countries by the World Health Organization using DSM-IV criteria, reported in 2009 a prevalence\nestimate of around 6% for personality disorders. The rate sometimes varied with demographic and socioeconomic factors, and\nfunctional impairment was partly explained by co-occurring mental disorders.\n[87] \nIn the US, screening data from the National\nComorbidity Survey Replication between 2001 and 2003, combined with interviews of a subset of respondents, indicated a\npopulation prevalence of around 9% for personality disorders in total. Functional disability associated with the diagnoses\nappeared to be largely due to co-occurring mental disorders (Axis I in the DSM).\n[88] \nThis statistic has been supported by other\nstudies in the US, with overall global prevalence statistics ranging from 9% to 11%.\n[89][90]\nA UK national epidemiological study (based on DSM-IV screening criteria), reclassified into levels of severity rather than just\ndiagnosis, reported in 2010 that the majority of people show some personality difficulties in one way or another (short of\nthreshold for diagnosis), while the prevalence of the most complex and severe cases (including meeting criteria for multiple\nEpidemiology\n\ndiagnoses in different clusters) was estimated at 1.3%. Even low levels of personality symptoms were associated with functional\nproblems, but the most severely in need of services was a much smaller group.\n[91] \nPersonality disorders (especially Cluster A)\nare found more commonly among homeless people.\n[92]\nThere are some sex differences in the frequency of personality disorders which are shown in the table below.\n[93]: 206 \nThe known\nprevalence of some personality disorders, especially borderline PD and antisocial PD are affected by diagnostic bias. This is due\nto many factors including disproportionately high research towards borderline PD and antisocial PD, alongside social and gender\nstereotypes, and the relationship between diagnosis rates and prevalence rates.\n[86] \nSince the removal of depressive PD, self-\ndefeating PD, sadistic PD and passive-aggressive PD from the DSM-5, studies analysing their prevalence and demographics\nhave been limited.\n\nSex differences in the frequency of personality disorders\nType of personality\ndisorder\nPredominant\nsex \nNotes\nParanoid personality\ndisorder \nInconclusive\nIn clinical samples men have higher rates, whereas epidemiologically there is a reported\nhigher rate of women\n[94] \nalthough due the controversy of paranoid personality disorder the\nusefulness of these results is disputed\n[86][95]\nSchizoid personality\ndisorder \nMale \nAbout 10% more common in males\n[96]\nSchizotypal personality\ndisorder \nInconclusive \nThe DSM-5 reports it is slightly more common in males, although other results suggest a\nprevalence of 4.2% in women and 3.7% in men\n[1][97]\nAntisocial personality\ndisorder \nMale \nAbout three times more common in men,\n[98] \nwith rates substantially higher in prison\npopulations, up to almost 50% in some prison populations\n[98]\nBorderline personality\ndisorder \nFemale\nDiagnosis rates vary from about three times more common in women, to only a minor\npredominance of women over men.

DSM-I Sociopathic personality disturbance subsection.\n[93]:\n 16\nPersonality disorder is a term with a distinctly modern meaning, owing in part to its clinical usage and the institutional character\nof modern psychiatry. The currently accepted meaning must be understood in the context of historical changing classification\nsystems such as DSM-IV and its predecessors. Although highly anachronistic, and ignoring radical differences in the character of\nsubjectivity and social relations, some have suggested similarities to other concepts going back to at least the ancient\nGreeks.\n[3]: 35 \nFor example, the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described 29 'character' types that he saw as deviations from the\nnorm, and similar views have been found in Asian, Arabic and Celtic cultures. A long-standing influence in the Western world\nwas Galen's concept of personality types, which he linked to the four humours proposed by Hippocrates.\nSuch views lasted into the eighteenth century, when experiments began to question the supposed biologically based humours and\n'temperaments'. Psychological concepts of character and 'self' became widespread. In the nineteenth century, 'personality'\nreferred to a person's conscious awareness of their behavior, a disorder of which could be linked to altered states such as\ndissociation. This sense of the term has been compared to the use of the term 'multiple personality disorder' in the first versions of\nthe DSM.\n[107]\nPhysicians in the early nineteenth century started to diagnose forms of insanity involving disturbed emotions and behaviors but\nseemingly without significant intellectual impairment or delusions or hallucinations. Philippe Pinel referred to this as ' manie sans\ndélire ' – mania without delusions – and described a number of cases mainly involving excessive or inexplicable anger or rage.\nBefore the 20th century\n\nJames Cowles Prichard advanced a similar concept he called moral insanity, which would be used to diagnose patients for some\ndecades. 'Moral' in this sense referred to affect (emotion or mood) rather than ethics, but it was arguably based in part on\nreligious, social and moral beliefs, with a pessimism about medical intervention so social control should take precedence.\n[108]\nThese categories were much different and broader than later definitions of personality disorder, while also being developed by\nsome into a more specific meaning of moral degeneracy akin to later ideas about 'psychopaths'. Separately, Richard von Krafft-\nEbing popularized the terms sadism and masochism, as well as homosexuality, as psychiatric issues.\nThe German psychiatrist Koch sought to make the moral insanity concept more scientific, and in 1891 suggested the phrase\n'psychopathic inferiority', theorized to be a congenital disorder. This referred to continual and rigid patterns of misconduct or\ndysfunction in the absence of apparent \"mental retardation\" or illness, supposedly without a moral judgment. Described as\ndeeply rooted in his Christian faith, his work established the concept of personality disorder as used today.\n[109]\nIn the early 20th century, another German psychiatrist, Emil Kraepelin, included a chapter on psychopathic inferiority in his\ninfluential work on clinical psychiatry for students and physicians. He suggested six types – excitable, unstable, eccentric, liar,\nswindler and quarrelsome. The categories were essentially defined by the most disordered criminal offenders observed,\ndistinguished between criminals by impulse, professional criminals, and morbid vagabonds who wandered through life.\nKraepelin also described three paranoid (meaning then delusional) disorders, resembling later concepts of schizophrenia,\ndelusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder. A diagnostic term for the latter concept would be included in the DSM\nfrom 1952, and from 1980 the DSM would also include schizoid, schizotypal; interpretations of earlier (1921) theories of Ernst\nKretschmer led to a distinction between these and another type later included in the DSM, avoidant personality disorder.\nIn 1933 Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin published his book Manifestations of Psychopathies: Statics,\nDynamics, Systematic Aspects, which was one of the first attempts to develop a detailed typology of psychopathies. Regarding\nmaladaptation, ubiquity, and stability as the three main symptoms of behavioral pathology, he distinguished nine clusters of\npsychopaths: cycloids (including constitutionally depressive, constitutionally excitable, cyclothymics, and emotionally labile),\nasthenics (including psychasthenics), schizoids (including dreamers), paranoiacs (including fanatics), epileptoids, hysterical\npersonalities (including pathological liars), unstable psychopaths, antisocial psychopaths, and constitutionally stupid.\n[110] \nSome\nelements of Gannushkin's typology were later incorporated into the theory developed by a Russian adolescent psychiatrist,\nAndrey Yevgenyevich Lichko, who was also interested in psychopathies along with their milder forms, the so-called\naccentuations of character.\n[111]\nIn 1939, psychiatrist David Henderson published a theory of 'psychopathic states' that contributed to popularly linking the term\nto anti-social behavior. Hervey M. Cleckley's 1941 text, The Mask of Sanity, based on his personal categorization of similarities\nhe noted in some prisoners, marked the start of the modern clinical conception of psychopathy and its popularist usage.\n[112]\nTowards the mid 20th century, psychoanalytic theories were coming to the fore based on work from the turn of the century being\npopularized by Sigmund Freud and others. This included the concept of character disorders, which were seen as enduring\nproblems linked not to specific symptoms but to pervasive internal conflicts or derailments of normal childhood development.\nThese were often understood as weaknesses of character or willful deviance, and were distinguished from neurosis or psychosis.\nThe term 'borderline' stems from a belief some individuals were functioning on the edge of those two categories, and a number\nof the other personality disorder categories were also heavily influenced by this approach, including dependent, obsessive–\ncompulsive and histrionic,\n[113] \nthe latter starting off as a conversion symptom of hysteria particularly associated with women,\nthen a hysterical personality, then renamed histrionic personality disorder in later versions of the DSM. A passive aggressive style\nwas defined clinically by Colonel William Menninger during World War II in the context of men's reactions to military\ncompliance, which would later be referenced as a personality disorder in the DSM.\n[114] \nOtto Kernberg was influential with\nregard to the concepts of borderline and narcissistic personalities later incorporated in 1980 as disorders into the DSM.\nMeanwhile, a more general personality psychology had been developing in academia and to some extent clinically. Gordon\nAllport published theories of personality traits from the 1920s—and Henry Murray advanced a theory called personology, which\ninfluenced a later key advocate of personality disorders, Theodore Millon. Tests were developing or being applied for personality\nevaluation, including projective tests such as the Rorschach test, as well as questionnaires such as the Minnesota Multiphasic\nPersonality Inventory. Around mid-century, Hans Eysenck was analysing traits and personality types, and psychiatrist Kurt\nSchneider was popularising a clinical use in place of the previously more usual terms 'character', 'temperament' or 'constitution'.\n20th century\n\nAmerican psychiatrists officially recognized concepts of enduring personality disturbances in the first Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders in the 1950s, which relied heavily on psychoanalytic concepts. Somewhat more neutral language\nwas employed in the DSM-II in 1968, though the terms and descriptions had only a slight resemblance to current definitions.\nThe DSM-III published in 1980 made some major changes, notably putting all personality disorders onto a second separate 'axis'\nalong with \"mental retardation\", intended to signify more enduring patterns, distinct from what were considered axis one mental\ndisorders. 'Inadequate' and 'asthenic' personality disorder' categories were deleted, and others were expanded into more types, or\nchanged from being personality disorders to regular disorders. Sociopathic personality disorder, which had been the term for\npsychopathy, was renamed Antisocial Personality Disorder. Most categories were given more specific 'operationalized'\ndefinitions, with standard criteria psychiatrists could agree on to conduct research and diagnose patients.\n[115] \nIn the DSM-III\nrevision, self-defeating personality disorder and sadistic personality disorder were included as provisional diagnoses requiring\nfurther study. They were dropped in the DSM-IV, though a proposed 'depressive personality disorder' was added; in addition, the\nofficial diagnosis of passive–aggressive personality disorder was dropped, tentatively renamed 'negativistic personality\ndisorder.'\n[116]\nInternational differences have been noted in how attitudes have developed towards the diagnosis of personality disorder. Kurt\nSchneider argued they were 'abnormal varieties of psychic life' and therefore not necessarily the domain of psychiatry, a view\nsaid to still have influence in Germany today. British psychiatrists have also been reluctant to address such disorders or consider\nthem on par with other mental disorders, which has been attributed partly to resource pressures within the National Health\nService, as well as to negative medical attitudes towards behaviors associated with personality disorders. In the US, the\nprevailing healthcare system and psychoanalytic tradition has been said to provide a rationale for private therapists to diagnose\nsome personality disorders more broadly and provide ongoing treatment for them.\n[117]\nPsychology portal\nParanoid personality disorder\nSchizoid personality disorder\nSchizotypal personality disorder\nAntisocial personality disorder\nBorderline personality disorder\nHistrionic personality disorder\nNarcissistic personality disorder\nAvoidant personality disorder\nDependent personality disorder\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder\nDepressive personality disorder\nPassive–aggressive personality disorder\nSadistic personality disorder\nSelf-defeating personality disorder\n1.

Psychology is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the\nboundaries between the natural and social sciences. Biological psychologists seek an understanding of the\nemergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim\nto understand the behavior of individuals and groups.\n[3][4]\nA professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. Some\npsychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. Some psychologists attempt to\nunderstand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. Others explore the physiological\nand neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\nPsychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective\nexperiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal\nrelationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They\nalso consider the unconscious mind.\n[5] \nResearch psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal\nand correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling\npsychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.\nWhile psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems,\nit is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By\nmany accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.\n[6][7][8] \nMany psychologists are involved in\nsome kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other\npsychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior.\nTypically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or\nhospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings.\n[9] \nYet\nothers are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and\nthe media.\nThe word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or soul. The latter part of the word\npsychology derives from -λογία \n-logia\n, which means \"study\" or \"research\".\n[10] \nThe word psychology was\nfirst used in the Renaissance.\n[11] \nIn its Latin form psychiologia, it was first employed by the Croatian\nhumanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on\nthe Nature of the Human Soul) in the decade 1510-1520\n[11][12] \nThe earliest known reference to the word\npsychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary. The dictionary refers\nto \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\"\n[13]\nΨ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived, is commonly\nassociated with the field of psychology.\nEtymology and definitions\n\nIn 1890, William James defined psychology as \"the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their\nconditions.\"\n[14] \nThis definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was\ncontested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who in 1913 asserted that the discipline\nis a natural science, the theoretical goal of which \"is the prediction and control of behavior.\"\n[15] \nSince\nJames defined \"psychology\", the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation.\n[16][15] \nFolk\npsychology is the understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people held by ordinary people, as\ncontrasted with psychology professionals' understanding.\n[17]\nThe ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study\nof psychology. In Ancient Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders.\n[18]\nHistorians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima\ntreatise),\n[19] \naddressed the workings of the mind.\n[20] \nAs early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician\nHippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes.\n[21] \nIn 387 BCE,\nPlato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that\nit was the heart.\n[22]\nIn China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius, and\nlater from the doctrines of Buddhism.\n[23] \nThis body of knowledge involves insights drawn from\nintrospection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe\nin term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and\nthe mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power.\nAn ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the\nnexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes\nmental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the\nbrain advanced during the Qing dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), Liu\nZhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain\nas the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of\ndreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function.\n[24]\nInfluenced by Hinduism, Indian philosophy explored distinctions in types of awareness. A central idea of\nthe Upanishads and other Vedic texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between\na person's transient mundane self and their eternal, unchanging soul. Divergent Hindu doctrines and\nBuddhism have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching\nhigher awareness. Yoga encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Theosophy, a\nreligion established by Russian-American philosopher Helena Blavatsky, drew inspiration from these\ndoctrines during her time in British India.\n[25][26]\nPsychology was of interest to Enlightenment thinkers in Europe. In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n(1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an\nindivisible continuum. He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is\nonly a matter of degree. Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science, writing Psychologia\nEmpirica in 1732 and Psychologia Rationalis in 1734. Immanuel Kant advanced the idea of anthropology\nas a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision. Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an\nexperimental psychology, writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry\nHistory\n\nJames McKeen Cattell, the first\npsychologist in the United States\nWilhelm Wundt (seated), a German\npsychologist, with colleagues in his\npsychological laboratory, the first of\nits kind, c. 1880\neven as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can\nbe separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but\nstill less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even\nobservation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\"\nIn 1783, Ferdinand Ueberwasser (1752–1812) designated himself Professor of Empirical Psychology and\nLogic and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by\nthe Napoleonic Wars.\n[27] \nAt the end of the Napoleonic era, Prussian authorities discontinued the Old\nUniversity of Münster.\n[27] \nHaving consulted philosophers Hegel and Herbart, however, in 1825 the\nPrussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly\ninfluential educational system. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.\n[28] \nIn\nEngland, early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism,\nviolence, and the country's crowded \"lunatic\" asylums.\n[29]\nPhilosopher John Stuart Mill believed that the human mind was\nopen to scientific investigation, even if the science is in some ways\ninexact.\n[30] \nMill proposed a \"mental \nchemistry\"\n in which\nelementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater\ncomplexity.\n[30] \nGustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics\nresearch in Leipzig in the 1830s. He articulated the principle that\nhuman perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to\nits intensity.\n[31]: 61 \nThe principle became known as the Weber–\nFechner law. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged\nKant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative\nresearch on the mind.\n[32][28] \nFechner's achievement was to show\nthat \"mental processes could not only be given numerical\nmagnitudes, but also that these could be measured by experimental\nmethods.\"\n[28] \nIn Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted\nparallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist\nWilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where\nhe established the psychological laboratory that brought\nexperimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking\ndown mental processes into the most basic components, motivated\nin part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its\nsuccessful investigation of the elements and structure of\nmaterials.\n[33] \nPaul Flechsig \nand \nEmil Kraepelin \nsoon created\nanother influential laboratory at Leipzig, a psychology-related lab,\nthat focused more on experimental psychiatry.\n[28]\nJames McKeen Cattell, a professor of psychology at the University\nof Pennsylvania and Columbia University and the co-founder of\nPsychological Review, was the first professor of psychology in the\nUnited States.\nBeginning of experimental psychology\n\nOne of the dogs used in Russian\npsychologist Ivan Pavlov's\nexperiment with a surgically\nimplanted cannula to measure saliva,\npreserved in the Pavlov Museum in\nRyazan, Russia\nThe German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a researcher at the\nUniversity of Berlin, was a 19th-century contributor to the field. He\npioneered the experimental study of memory and developed\nquantitative models of learning and forgetting.\n[34] \nIn the early 20th\ncentury, Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Koffka co-\nfounded the school of Gestalt psychology of Fritz Perls. The\napproach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that\nindividuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than\nreducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements,\nas in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of\nexperience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts.\nPsychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, and the\nUnited States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories.\n[35] \nG.\nStanley Hall, an American who studied with Wundt, founded a\npsychology lab that became internationally influential. The lab was located at Johns Hopkins University.\nHall, in turn, trained Yujiro Motora, who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to\nthe Imperial University of Tokyo.\n[36] \nWundt's assistant, Hugo Münsterberg, taught psychology at Harvard\nto students such as Narendra Nath Sen Gupta—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and\nlaboratory at the University of Calcutta.\n[25] \nWundt's students Walter Dill Scott, Lightner Witmer, and James\nMcKeen Cattell worked on developing tests of mental ability. Cattell, who also studied with eugenicist\nFrancis Galton, went on to found the Psychological Corporation. Witmer focused on the mental testing of\nchildren; Scott, on employee selection.\n[31]: 60\nAnother student of Wundt, the Englishman Edward Titchener, created the psychology program at Cornell\nUniversity and advanced \"structuralist\" psychology. The idea behind structuralism was to analyze and\nclassify different aspects of the mind, primarily through the method of introspection.\n[37] \nWilliam James,\nJohn Dewey, and Harvey Carr advanced the idea of functionalism, an expansive approach to psychology\nthat underlined the Darwinian idea of a behavior's usefulness to the individual. In 1890, James wrote an\ninfluential book, The Principles of Psychology, which expanded on the structuralism. He memorably\ndescribed \"stream of consciousness.\" James's ideas interested many American students in the emerging\ndiscipline.\n[37][14][31]: 178–82 \nDewey integrated psychology with societal concerns, most notably by\npromoting progressive education, inculcating moral values in children, and assimilating\nimmigrants.\n[31]: 196–200\nA different strain of experimentalism, with a greater connection to physiology, emerged in South America,\nunder the leadership of Horacio G. Piñero at the University of Buenos Aires.\n[38] \nIn Russia, too, researchers\nplaced greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology, beginning with Ivan Sechenov's 1873 essay,\n\"Who Is to Develop Psychology and How?\" Sechenov advanced the idea of brain reflexes and\naggressively promoted a deterministic view of human behavior.\n[39] \nThe Russian-Soviet physiologist Ivan\nPavlov discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed \"classical conditioning\" and applied the\nprocess to human beings.\n[40]\nConsolidation and funding\n\nOne of the earliest psychology societies was La Société de Psychologie Physiologique in France, which\nlasted from 1885 to 1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the\nInternational Union of Psychological Science took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair\ncelebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was one of three Americans among the\n400 attendees. The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892. The\nInternational Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international\nparticipation. The Sixth Congress, held in Geneva in 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and\nJapanese, as well as Esperanto. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with\nsubstantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took\nplace at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA.\n[35]\nTokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East. New ideas about\npsychology diffused from Japan into China.\n[24][36]\nAmerican psychology gained status upon the U.S.'s entry into World War I. A standing committee headed\nby Robert Yerkes administered mental tests (\"Army Alpha\" and \"Army Beta\") to almost 1.8 million\nsoldiers.\n[41] \nSubsequently, the Rockefeller family, via the Social Science Research Council, began to\nprovide funding for behavioral research.\n[42][43] \nRockefeller charities funded the National Committee on\nMental Hygiene, which disseminated the concept of mental illness and lobbied for applying ideas from\npsychology to child rearing.\n[41][44] \nThrough the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of Alfred\nKinsey, Rockefeller foundations helped establish research on sexuality in the U.S.\n[45] \nUnder the influence\nof the Carnegie-funded Eugenics Record Office, the Draper-funded Pioneer Fund, and other institutions,\nthe eugenics movement also influenced American psychology. In the 1910s and 1920s, eugenics became a\nstandard topic in psychology classes.\n[46] \nIn contrast to the US, in the UK psychology was met with\nantagonism by the scientific and medical establishments, and up until 1939, there were only six psychology\nchairs in universities in England.\n[47]\nDuring World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. military and intelligence agencies established themselves\nas leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces and in the new Office of Strategic Services\nintelligence agency. University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university\nresearchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941. He observed that \"the last few months of\nthe war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-\npropaganda policy for the United States Government.\" Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had\nsignificant roles in managing the domestic economy.\n[48] \nThe Army rolled out its new General Classification\nTest to assess the ability of millions of soldiers. The Army also engaged in large-scale psychological\nresearch of troop morale and mental health.\n[49] \nIn the 1950s, the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford\nFoundation collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to fund research on psychological\nwarfare.\n[50] \nIn 1965, public controversy called attention to the Army's Project Camelot, the \"Manhattan\nProject\" of social science, an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze the plans\nand policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes.\n[51][52]\nIn Germany after World War I, psychology held institutional power through the military, which was\nsubsequently expanded along with the rest of the military during Nazi Germany.\n[28] \nUnder the direction of\nHermann Göring's cousin Matthias Göring, the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute was renamed the Göring\nInstitute. Freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the anti-Jewish policies of the Nazi\nParty, and all psychologists had to distance themselves from Freud and Adler, founders of psychoanalysis\nwho were also Jewish.\n[53] \nThe Göring Institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to\ncreate a \"New German Psychotherapy.\" This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the\n\noverall goals of the Reich. As described by one physician, \"Despite the importance of analysis, spiritual\nguidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental\nproblems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the Volk and the Gemeinschaft.\" Psychologists\nwere to provide Seelenführung [lit., soul guidance], the leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the\nnew vision of a German community.\n[54] \nHarald Schultz-Hencke melded psychology with the Nazi theory\nof biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed.\n[55] \nJohannes\nHeinrich Schultz, a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training,\nprominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised\ntechniques for facilitating this process.\n[56]\nAfter the war, new institutions were created although some psychologists, because of their Nazi affiliation,\nwere discredited. Alexander Mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called\nPsyche. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Mitscherlich established the first clinical\npsychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the\nrequired studies of medical students.\n[57]\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks promoted psychology as a way to engineer the \"New Man\"\nof socialism. Consequently, university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in\npsychology. At the completion of training, positions were made available for those students at schools,\nworkplaces, cultural institutions, and in the military. The Russian state emphasized pedology and the study\nof child development. Lev Vygotsky became prominent in the field of child development.\n[39] \nThe\nBolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual\nrepression.\n[58]: 84–6 [59] \nAlthough pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in 1936, psychology\nmaintained its privileged position as an instrument of the Soviet Union.\n[39] \nStalinist purges took a heavy toll\nand instilled a climate of fear in the profession, as elsewhere in Soviet society.\n[58]: 22 \nFollowing World War\nII, Jewish psychologists past and present, including Lev Vygotsky, A.R. Luria, and Aron Zalkind, were\ndenounced; Ivan Pavlov (posthumously) and Stalin himself were celebrated as heroes of Soviet\npsychology.\n[58]: 25–6, 48–9 \nSoviet academics experienced a degree of liberalization during the Khrushchev\nThaw. The topics of cybernetics, linguistics, and genetics became acceptable again. The new field of\nengineering psychology emerged. The field involved the study of the mental aspects of complex jobs (such\nas pilot and cosmonaut). Interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as Georgy\nShchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches to human behavior.\n[58]: 27–33\nTwentieth-century Chinese psychology originally modeled itself on U.S. psychology, with translations from\nAmerican authors like William James, the establishment of university psychology departments and journals,\nand the establishment of groups including the Chinese Association of Psychological Testing (1930) and the\nChinese Psychological Society (1937). Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and\nlanguage learning. Chinese psychologists were drawn to the idea that education would enable\nmodernization. John Dewey, who lectured to Chinese audiences between 1919 and 1921, had a significant\ninfluence on psychology in China. Chancellor T'sai Yuan-p'ei introduced him at Peking University as a\ngreater thinker than Confucius. Kuo Zing-yang who received a PhD at the University of California,\nBerkeley, became President of Zhejiang University and popularized behaviorism.\n[60]: 5–9 \nAfter the Chinese\nCommunist Party gained control of the country, the Stalinist Soviet Union became the major influence, with\nMarxism–Leninism the leading social doctrine and Pavlovian conditioning the approved means of behavior\nchange. Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a \"reflective\" consciousness, envisioning an\n\"active consciousness\" (pinyin: tzu-chueh neng-tung-li) able to transcend material conditions through hard\nwork and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of \"recognition\" (pinyin: jen-shih) which referred\n\nto the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview; failure to correspond\nwith party doctrine was \"incorrect recognition.\"\n[60]: 9–17 \nPsychology education was centralized under the\nChinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by the State Council. In 1951, the academy created a\nPsychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology. Because most leading\npsychologists were educated in the United States, the first concern of the academy was the re-education of\nthese psychologists in the Soviet doctrines. Child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally\ncohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.\n[60]: 18–24\nWomen in the early 1900s started to make key findings within the world of psychology. In 1923, Anna\nFreud,\n[61] \nthe daughter of Sigmund Freud, built on her father's work using different defense mechanisms\n(denial, repression, and suppression) to psychoanalyze children. She believed that once a child reached the\nlatency period, child analysis could be used as a mode of therapy. She stated it is important focus on the\nchild's environment, support their development, and prevent neurosis. She believed a child should be\nrecognized as their own person with their own right and have each session catered to the child's specific\nneeds. She encouraged drawing, moving freely, and expressing themselves in any way. This helped build a\nstrong therapeutic alliance with child patients, which allows psychologists to observe their normal behavior.\nShe continued her research on the impact of children after family separation, children with socio-\neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, and all stages of child development from infancy to adolescence.\nFunctional periodicity, the belief women are mentally and physically impaired during menstruation,\nimpacted women's rights because employers were less likely to hire them due to the belief they would be\nincapable of working for 1 week a month. Leta Stetter Hollingworth wanted to prove this hypothesis and\nEdward L. Thorndike's theory, that women have lesser psychological and physical traits than men and were\nsimply mediocre, incorrect. Hollingworth worked to prove differences were not from male genetic\nsuperiority, but from culture. She also included the concept of women's impairment during menstruation in\nher research. She recorded both women and men performances on tasks (cognitive, perceptual, and motor)\nfor three months. No evidence was found of decreased performance due to a woman's menstrual cycle.\n[62]\nShe also challenged the belief intelligence is inherited and women here are intellectually inferior to men.\nShe stated that women do not reach positions of power due to the societal norms and roles they are\nassigned. As she states in her article, \"Variability as related to sex differences in achievement: A\nCritique\",\n[63] \nthe largest problem women have is the social order that was built due to the assumption\nwomen have less interests and abilities than men. To further prove her point, she completed another\nexperiment with infants who have not been influenced by the environment of social norms, like the adult\nmale getting more opportunities than women. She found no difference between infants besides size. After\nthis research proved the original hypothesis wrong, Hollingworth was able to show there is no difference\nbetween the physiological and psychological traits of men and women, and women are not impaired during\nmenstruation.\n[64]\nThe first half of the 1900s was filled with new theories and it was a turning point for women's recognition\nwithin the field of psychology. In addition to the contributions made by Leta Stetter Hollingworth and Anna\nFreud, Mary Whiton Calkins invented the paired associates technique of studying memory and developed\nself-psychology.\n[65] \nKaren Horney developed the concept of \"womb envy\" and neurotic needs.\n[66]\nWomen in psychology\n1900 - 1949\n\nPsychoanalyst Melanie Klein impacted developmental psychology with her research of play therapy.\n[67]\nThese great discoveries and contributions were made during struggles of sexism, discrimination, and little\nrecognition for their work.\nWomen in the second half of the 20th century continued to do research that had large-scale impacts on the\nfield of psychology. Mary Ainsworth's work centered around attachment theory. Building off fellow\npsychologist John Bowlby, Ainsworth spent years doing fieldwork to understand the development of\nmother-infant relationships. In doing this field research, Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation\nProcedure, a laboratory procedure meant to study attachment style by separating and uniting a child with\ntheir mother several different times under different circumstances. These field studies are also where she\ndeveloped her attachment theory and the order of attachment styles, which was a landmark for\ndevelopmental psychology.\n[68][69] \nBecause of her work, Ainsworth became one of the most cited\npsychologists of all time.\n[70] \nMamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology that changed the field\nwith her research. She was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology\nfrom Columbia University, along with her husband, Kenneth Clark. Her master's thesis, \"The Development\nof Consciousness in Negro Pre-School Children,\" argued that black children's self-esteem was negatively\nimpacted by racial discrimination. She and her husband conduced research building off her thesis\nthroughout the 1940s. These tests, called the doll tests, asked young children to choose between identical\ndolls whose only difference was race, and they found that the majority of the children preferred the white\ndolls and attributed positive traits to them. Repeated over and over again, these tests helped to determine the\nnegative effects of racial discrimination and segregation on black children's self-image and development. In\n1954, this research would help decide the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, leading to the\nend of legal segregation across the nation. Clark went on to be an influential figure in psychology, her work\ncontinuing to focus on minority youth.\n[71]\nAs the field of psychology developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century, women in the field\nadvocated for their voices to be heard and their perspectives to be valued. Second-wave feminism did not\nmiss psychology. An outspoken feminist in psychology was Naomi Weisstein, who was an accomplished\nresearcher in psychology and neuroscience, and is perhaps best known for her paper, \"Kirche, Kuche,\nKinder as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female.\" Psychology Constructs the Female criticized\nthe field of psychology for centering men and using biology too much to explain gender differences without\ntaking into account social factors.\n[72] \nHer work set the stage for further research to be done in social\npsychology, especially in gender construction.\n[73] \nOther women in the field also continued advocating for\nwomen in psychology, creating the Association for Women in Psychology to criticize how the field treated\nwomen. E. Kitsch Child, Phyllis Chesler, and Dorothy Riddle were some of the founding members of the\norganization in 1969.\n[74][75]\nThe latter half of the 20th century further diversified the field of psychology, with women of color reaching\nnew milestones. In 1962, Martha Bernal became the first Latina woman to get a Ph.D. in psychology. In\n1969, Marigold Linton, the first Native American woman to get a Ph.D. in psychology, founded the\nNational Indian Education Association. She was also a founding member of the Society for Advancement\n1950 - 1999\n\nof Chicanos and Native Americans in Science. In 1971, The Network of Indian Psychologists was\nestablished by Carolyn Attneave. Harriet McAdoo was appointed to the White House Conference on\nFamilies in 1979.\n[76]\nBabette Rothschild, a clinical social worker, invented Somatic Trauma Therapy. Somatic Trauma Therapy\nutilizes the body to experience, process, and heal from traumatic experiences. To spread her technique she\nwrote several books, the most prominent being The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma,\nTrauma, and Trauma Treatment\n[77]\n, which was published in 2000.\n[78]\nDr. Tara Brach has written several bestselling books that combine Western and Eastern psychology. She\nfounded the Insight Meditation Community of Washington in 1998 and co-founded two teaching programs,\nBanyan, and the Mindfulness Mediation Teacher Training Program. The latter has served people from 74\ndifferent countries.\n[79]\nDr. Kay Redfield Jamison, named one of Time Magazine's \"Best Doctors in the United States\" is a lecturer,\npsychologist, and writer. She is known for her vast modern contributions to bipolar disorder and her books\nAn Unquiet Mind\n[80] \n(Published 1995) and Nothing Was the Same\n[81] \n(Published in 2009). Having Bipolar\nDisorder herself, she has written several memoirs about her experience with suicidal thoughts, manic\nbehaviors, depression, and other issues that arise from being Bipolar.\n[78]\nDr. Angela Neal-Barnett views psychology through a Black lens and dedicated her career to focusing on\nthe anxiety of African American women.

In 2007 she became the Senior Director of the Women's Programs Office of the American\nPsychological Association. Therefore, she was one of the creators of the APA's \"Women in Psychology\nTimeline\" which features the accomplishments of women of color in psychology.

This organization\nbecame the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council\nof Psychologists in 1959. Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the\nAsian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial\ngroups in the profession.\n[88]\nThe International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) is the world federation of national\npsychological societies. The IUPsyS was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the United Nations\nEducational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO).\n[35][89] \nPsychology departments have since\nproliferated around the world, based primarily on the Euro-American model.\n[25][89] \nSince 1966, the Union\nhas published the International Journal of Psychology.\n[35] \nIAAP and IUPsyS agreed in 1976 each to hold a\ncongress every four years, on a staggered basis.\n[88]\nIUPsyS recognizes 66 national psychology associations and at least 15 others exist.\n[88] \nThe American\nPsychological Association is the oldest and largest.\n[88] \nIts membership has increased from 5,000 in 1945 to\n100,000 in the present day.\n[37] \nThe APA includes 54 divisions, which since 1960 have steadily proliferated\nto include more specialties. Some of these divisions, such as the Society for the Psychological Study of\nSocial Issues and the American Psychology–Law Society, began as autonomous groups.\n[88]\nThe Interamerican Psychological Society, founded in 1951, aspires to promote psychology across the\nWestern Hemisphere. It holds the Interamerican Congress of Psychology and had 1,000 members in year\n2000. The European Federation of Professional Psychology Associations, founded in 1981, represents 30\nnational associations with a total of 100,000 individual members. At least 30 other international\norganizations represent psychologists in different regions.\n[88]\nIn some places, governments legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent\nthemselves as a \"psychologist.\"\n[90] \nThe APA defines a psychologist as someone with a doctoral degree in\npsychology.\n[91]\nDisciplinary organizations\nInstitutions\nBoundaries\n\nFalse-color representations of\ncerebral fiber pathways affected, per\nVan Horn et al.\n[V]: 3\nEarly practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology, which in the\nlate nineteenth century enjoyed popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James). Some\npeople considered parapsychology to be part of \"psychology.\" Parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism\nwere major topics at the early International Congresses. But students of these fields were eventually\nostracized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905.\n[35] \nParapsychology persisted for a\ntime at Imperial University in Japan, with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by\nTomokichi Fukurai, but it was mostly shunned by 1913.\n[36]\nAs a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a \"soft\" science. Philosopher of\nscience Thomas Kuhn's 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking\nagreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature hard sciences such as chemistry and\nphysics.\n[92] \nBecause some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as self-reports in surveys and\nquestionnaires, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Skeptics have suggested that\npersonality, thinking, and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-\nreports, which may be problematic. Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly\nmeasure these elusive phenomenological entities.\n[93][94][95]\nDivisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences\nof individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. Critics\ninside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by\na \"cult of empiricism\", which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to\nmethods derived from the physical sciences.\n[96]: 36–7 \nFeminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific\nobjectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically) mostly male researchers.\n[41] \nJean Grimshaw, for\nexample, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its\nefforts to control behavior.\n[96]: 120\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought\nand feeling, and therefore an important area of study. Behaviorial\nneuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the\napplication of biological principles to the study of physiological and\ngenetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other\nanimals. The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific\nstudy of the behavior and mental processes of non-human\nanimals.\n[97] \nA leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been\nwhether and how mental functions are localized in the brain. From\nPhineas Gage to H.M. and Clive Wearing, individual people with\nmental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired\nnew discoveries in this area.\n[98] \nModern behavioral neuroscience\ncould be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left\nfrontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, Carl\nWernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.\n[99]: 20–2\nMajor schools of thought\nBiological\n\nSkinner's teaching machine, a\nmechanical invention to automate\nthe task of programmed instruction\nThe contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience focuses on the physical basis of behavior. Behaviorial\nneuroscientists use animal models, often relying on rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular\nmechanisms that underlie behaviors involved in learning, memory, and fear responses.\n[100] \nCognitive\nneuroscientists, by using neural imaging tools, investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in\nhumans. Neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine how an individual's behavior\nand cognition are related to the brain. The biopsychosocial model is a cross-disciplinary, holistic model that\nconcerns the ways in which interrelationships of biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors\naffect health and behavior.\n[101]\nEvolutionary psychology approaches thought and behavior from a modern evolutionary perspective. This\nperspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral\nenvironments. Evolutionary psychologists attempt to find out how human psychological traits are evolved\nadaptations, the results of natural selection or sexual selection over the course of human evolution.\n[102]\nThe history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism. The idea of white\nsupremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by\nEuropeans.\n[103] \nCarl von Linnaeus's four-fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent\nand severe, Americans as contented and free, Asians as ritualistic, and Africans as lazy and capricious. Race\nwas also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and\ndysaesthesia aethiopica\n—the behavior of uncooperative African slaves.\n[104] \nAfter the creation of\nexperimental psychology, \"ethnical psychology\" emerged as a subdiscipline, based on the assumption that\nstudying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of\nmore evolved humans.\n[105]\nA tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and\nlower-animal behavior is learned. A principle associated with\nbehavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning\napply to humans and non-human animals. Behavioral researchers\nhave developed a treatment known as behavior modification, which\nis used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with\ndesirable ones.\nEarly behavioral researchers studied stimulus–response pairings,\nnow known as classical conditioning. They demonstrated that when\na biologically potent stimulus (e.g., food that elicits salivation) is\npaired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g., a bell) over several\nlearning trials, the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus\nelicits. Ivan Pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously\nlinked with food—became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods\non humans.\n[39] \nIn the United States, Edward Lee Thorndike initiated \"connectionist\" studies by trapping\nanimals in \"puzzle boxes\" and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911, \"There can be no\nmoral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts.\"\n[31]: 212–5 \nFrom\n1910 to 1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from\nmentalism and towards \"behavioralism.\" In 1913, John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this\nschool of thought.\n[31]: 218–27 \nWatson's famous Little Albert experiment in 1920 was at first thought to\nBehaviorist\n\nThe film of the Little Albert\nexperiment\nBaddeley's model of working memory\ndemonstrate that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill\nphobias (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human,\n[15][106]\nalthough such a conclusion was likely an exaggeration.\n[107] \nKarl\nLashley, a close collaborator with Watson, examined biological\nmanifestations of learning in the brain.\n[98]\nClark L. Hull, Edwin Guthrie, and others did much to help\nbehaviorism become a widely used paradigm.\n[37] \nA new method of\n\"instrumental\" or \"operant\" conditioning added the concepts of\nreinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change.\nRadical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the\nmind, especially the unconscious mind, which they considered\nimpossible to assess scientifically.\n[108] \nOperant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and\npopularized in the U.S. by B.F. Skinner, who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist\nmovement.\n[109][110]\nNoam Chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist\nprinciples could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language\nuse.\n[111][112] \nThe review, which was scathing, did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within\npsychology.\n[31]: 282–5 \nMartin Seligman and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a\nstate of \"learned helplessness\", which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to\npsychology.\n[113][114] \nEdward C. Tolman advanced a hybrid \"cognitive behavioral\" model, most notably\nwith his 1948 publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the\nend of a maze.\n[115] \nSkinner's behaviorism did not die, in part because it generated successful practical\napplications.\n[112]\nThe Association for Behavior Analysis International was founded in 1974 and by 2003 had members from\n42 countries. The field has gained a foothold in Latin America and Japan.\n[116] \nApplied behavior analysis is\nthe term used for the application of the principles of operant conditioning to change socially significant\nbehavior (it supersedes the term, \"behavior modification\").\n[117]\nCognitive psychology involves the study of mental processes,\nincluding perception, attention, language comprehension and\nproduction, memory, and problem solving.\n[118] \nResearchers in the\nfield of cognitive psychology are sometimes called cognitivists.\nThey rely on an information processing model of mental\nfunctioning. Cognitivist research is informed by functionalism and\nexperimental psychology.\nStarting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by\nWundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental\npsychology became increasingly cognitivist and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider, interdisciplinary\ncognitive science.\n[119][120] \nSome called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the\nanti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.\n[120]\nCognitive\n\nThe Müller–Lyer illusion.\nPsychologists make inferences\nabout mental processes from shared\nphenomena such as optical illusions.\nGreen Red Blue\nPurple Blue Purple\nBlue Purple Red\nGreen Purple Green\nThe Stroop effect is the\nfact that naming the color\nof the first set of words is\neasier and quicker than\nthe second.\nAlbert Bandura helped along the\ntransition in psychology from\nbehaviorism to cognitive psychology.\nBandura and other social learning\ntheorists advanced the idea of vicarious\nlearning. In other words, they advanced\nthe view that a child can learn by\nobserving the immediate social\nenvironment and not necessarily from\nhaving been reinforced for enacting a\nbehavior, although they did not rule out\nthe influence of reinforcement on\nlearning a behavior.\n[121]\nTechnological advances also renewed interest in mental states and\nmental representations. English neuroscientist Charles Sherrington\nand Canadian psychologist Donald O. Hebb used experimental\nmethods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and\nfunction of the brain. The rise of computer science, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence underlined the\nvalue of comparing information processing in humans and machines.\nA popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias, or irrational thought. Psychologists (and\neconomists) have classified and described a sizeable catalog of biases which recur frequently in human\nthought. The availability heuristic, for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something\nwhich happens to come readily to mind.\n[122]\nElements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy,\na form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis and\nAmerican psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck.\nOn a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists,\ncognitive neuroscientists, linguists, and researchers in artificial intelligence, human–computer interaction,\nand computational neuroscience. The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as\nphilosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience.\n[123] \nComputer simulations are sometimes used to\nmodel phenomena of interest.\nSocial psychology is concerned with how behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and the social environment\ninfluence human interactions.\n[124] \nSocial psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an\nindividual's behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion) and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes\nabout other people. Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of\nunderstanding how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of group dynamics\ninvolves research on the nature of leadership, organizational communication, and related phenomena. In\nrecent years, social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the\nSocial\n\nFront row: Sigmund Freud, G.\nStanley Hall, Carl Jung].

Some concepts that sociologists have\napplied to the study of psychiatric disorders, concepts such as the social role, sick role, social class, life\nevents, culture, migration, and total institution, have influenced social psychologists.\n[125]\nPsychoanalysis is a collection of theories and therapeutic techniques\nintended to analyze the unconscious mind and its impact on\neveryday life. These theories and techniques inform treatments for\nmental disorders.\n[126][127][128] \nPsychoanalysis originated in the\n1890s, most prominently with the work of Sigmund Freud. Freud's\npsychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods,\nintrospection, and clinical observation. It became very well known,\nlargely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and\nthe unconscious.\n[58]: 84–6 \nFreud pioneered the methods of free\nassociation and dream interpretation.\n[129][130]\nPsychoanalytic theory is not monolithic. Other well-known\npsychoanalytic thinkers who diverged from Freud include Alfred\nAdler, Carl Jung, Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott,\nKaren Horney, Erich Fromm, John Bowlby, Freud's daughter Anna\nFreud, and Harry Stack Sullivan. These individuals ensured that\npsychoanalysis would evolve into diverse schools of thought. Among these schools are ego psychology,\nobject relations, and interpersonal, Lacanian, and relational psychoanalysis.\nPsychologists such as Hans Eysenck and philosophers including Karl Popper sharply criticized\npsychoanalysis. Popper argued that psychoanalysis was not falsifiable (no claim it made could be proven\nwrong) and therefore inherently not a scientific discipline,\n[131] \nwhereas Eysenck advanced the view that\npsychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data. By the end of the 20th century,\npsychology departments in American universities mostly had marginalized Freudian theory, dismissing it as\na \"desiccated and dead\" historical artifact.\n[132] \nResearchers such as António Damásio, Oliver Sacks, and\nJoseph LeDoux; and individuals in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis have defended some of\nFreud's ideas on scientific grounds.\n[133]\nHumanistic psychology, which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology,\n[135] \nstresses free\nwill and self-actualization.\n[136] \nIt emerged in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in\nreaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis.\n[137] \nThe humanistic approach seeks to view the whole\nperson, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions.\n[138] \nHumanistic psychology also\nfocuses on personal growth, self-identity, death, aloneness, and freedom. It emphasizes subjective meaning,\nthe rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the\nhumanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy\nof human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy.\nPsychoanalytic\nExistential-humanistic\n\nPsychologist Abraham Maslow in\n1943 posited that humans have a\nhierarchy of needs, and it makes\nsense to fulfill the basic needs first\nbefore higher-order needs can be\nmet.\n[134]\nLater, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to\nscientific study. Positive psychology is the study of factors which\ncontribute to human happiness and well-being, focusing more on\npeople who are currently healthy. In 2010, Clinical Psychological\nReview published a special issue devoted to positive psychological\ninterventions, such as gratitude journaling and the physical\nexpression of gratitude. It is, however, far from clear that positive\npsychology is effective in making people happier.\n[139][140] \nPositive\npsychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their\neffects are thought to be somewhat better than placebo effects.\nThe American Association for Humanistic Psychology, formed in\n1963, declared:\nHumanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward\nthe whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or\nschool. It stands for respect for the worth of persons,\nrespect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as\nto acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new\naspects of human behavior. As a \"third force\" in\ncontemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics\nhaving little place in existing theories and systems: e.g.,\nlove, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-\ngratification, self-actualization, higher values, being,\nbecoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection,\nnaturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity,\nautonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play,\ntranscendental experience, peak experience, courage, and\nrelated concepts.\n[141]\nExistential psychology emphasizes the need to understand a client's total orientation towards the world.\nExistential psychology is opposed to reductionism, behaviorism, and other methods that objectify the\nindividual.\n[136] \nIn the 1950s and 1960s, influenced by philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Martin\nHeidegger, psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rollo May helped to develop existential\npsychology. Existential psychotherapy, which follows from existential psychology, is a therapeutic\napproach that is based on the idea that a person's inner conflict arises from that individual's confrontation\nwith the givens of existence. Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binswanger and American psychologist George\nKelly may also be said to belong to the existential school.\n[142] \nExistential psychologists tend to differ from\nmore \"humanistic\" psychologists in the former's relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively\npositive assessment of anxiety.\n[143] \nExistential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death,\nfree will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives; meaning can be\ndeepened by the acceptance of free will, which is requisite to living an authentic life, albeit often with\nanxiety with regard to death.\n[144]\n\nAustrian existential psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl drew evidence of meaning's\ntherapeutic power from reflections upon his own internment.\n[145] \nHe created a variation of existential\npsychotherapy called logotherapy, a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning (in one's\nlife), as opposed to Adler's Nietzschean doctrine of \nwill to power \nor Freud's \nwill to pleasure\n.\n[146]\nPersonality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Theories of\npersonality vary across different psychological schools of thought. Each theory carries different assumptions\nabout such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According\nto Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-ego.\n[147] \nBy contrast,\ntrait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key\ntraits. Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis.\nAlthough the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model\nsuggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion–\nintroversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality. Raymond Cattell empirically derived a\ntheory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum\nfactors.\n[148][149][150][151] \nSince the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness,\nextraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality.\n[152]\nDimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional\nassessment has been included in the DSM-V. However, despite a plethora of research into the various\nversions of the \"Big Five\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static\nconceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality\nconstructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan.\n[153][154]\nAn early example of personality assessment was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, constructed during\nWorld War I. The popular, although psychometrically inadequate, Myers–Briggs Type Indicator\n[155] \nwas\ndeveloped to assess individuals' \"personality types\" according to the personality theories of Carl Jung. The\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), despite its name, is more a dimensional measure of\npsychopathology than a personality measure.\n[156] \nCalifornia Psychological Inventory \ncontains 20\npersonality scales (e.g., independence, tolerance).\n[157] \nThe International Personality Item Pool, which is in\nthe public domain, has become a source of scales that can be used personality assessment.\n[158]\nStudy of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the individual's awareness but that is believed\nto influence conscious thought and behavior, was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first\npsychology experiments conducted in the United States, C.S. Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that\nresearch subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the\ndifference.\n[159] \nFreud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind, particularly when he referred to an\nuncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech (a Freudian slip) or to his efforts to interpret\ndreams.\n[160] \nHis 1901 book \nThe Psychopathology of Everyday Life \ncatalogs hundreds of everyday events\nThemes\nPersonality\nUnconscious mind\n\nthat Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious\nmind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the\nsubject.\n[161]\nThe concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychology. Cognitive psychologists have\nused a \"filter\" model of attention. According to the model, much information processing takes place below\nthe threshold of consciousness, and only certain stimuli, limited by their nature and number, make their way\nthrough the filter. Much research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly\ninfluence thoughts and behavior.\n[161] \nBecause of the unreliability of self-reporting, a major hurdle in this\ntype of research involves demonstrating that a subject's conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulus.\nFor this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memory. In another\napproach, one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective\nthreshold.\n[162]\nThe automaticity model of John Bargh and others involves the ideas of automaticity and unconscious\nprocessing in our understanding of social behavior,\n[163][164] \nalthough there has been dispute with regard to\nreplication.\n[165][166] \nSome experimental data suggest that the brain begins to consider taking actions before\nthe mind becomes aware of them.\n[167] \nThe influence of unconscious forces on people's choices bears on the\nphilosophical question of free will. John Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer describe free will as an\nillusion.\n[163][164][168]\nSome psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a\nparticular time. It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a\nbehavior. Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention, in a\nsense similar to the concept of will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian\nthinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.\n[169] \nAccording to drive theory, the\nforces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis,\nlike biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system. Psychoanalysts believed\nthat these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche.\nClassical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle,\nroughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept\nof the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic\nevents.\n[170] \nMeanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain,\nreward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure\nin drinking.\n[169][171] \nClark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.\n[172]\nHunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animals.\n[171]\nHumans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained\nas resulting from desires for belonging, positive self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and\ncontrol.\n[173][174]\nMotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that eating,\nfor example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for homeostasis—an important factor\ncausing the experience of hunger—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and\ncost.\n[171] \nAbstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion: the\nMotivation\n\nDevelopmental psychologists engage\na child with a book and then make\nobservations based on how the child\ninteracts with the object.\nadoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.\n[175] \nVohs and\nBaumeister suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfillment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations\nsometimes obey a \"getting begets wanting\" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs,\nor money, the more you want it. They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and\nsleep.\n[176]\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why\nthe thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change\nover the course of their lives.\n[177] \nSome credit Charles Darwin with\nconducting the first systematic study within the rubric of\ndevelopmental psychology, having published in 1877 a short paper\ndetailing the development of innate forms of communication based\non his observations of his infant son.\n[178] \nThe main origins of the\ndiscipline, however, are found in the work of Jean Piaget. Like\nPiaget, developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on\nthe development of cognition from infancy to adolescence. Later,\ndevelopmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition\nover the life span. In addition to studying cognition, developmental\npsychologists have also come to focus on affective, behavioral,\nmoral, social, and neural development.\nDevelopmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methods. For example, they\nmake observations of children in natural settings such as preschools\n[179] \nand engage them in experimental\ntasks.\n[180] \nSuch tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the\nchild and scientifically useful. Developmental researchers have even devised clever methods to study the\nmental processes of infants.\n[181] \nIn addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study\naging and processes throughout the life span, including old age.\n[182] \nThese psychologists draw on the full\nrange of psychological theories to inform their research.\n[177]\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying\ndegrees.\n[183][184] \nThese two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of\nindividuals and families. An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression\nfrom a depressed mother to her offspring. A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an\noffspring, by virtue of their having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at\nrisk for developing depression. On the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in\nan offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother. Genes and\nenvironment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded. A depressed mother may both\ncarry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that\nincreases the risk of depression in her child.\n[185]\nBehavioral genetics researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and\nunderstand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.\n[102] \nTraditionally the research has\ninvolved twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be\nDevelopment psychology\nGenes and environment\n\nFrancis Galton, a pioneer of the\nexperimental psychology field\npartially un-confounded. More recently, gene-focused research has contributed to understanding genetic\ncontributions to the development of psychological traits.\nThe availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to\nmeasure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are\nassociated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide\nassociation studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in\nHuntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that\ngene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that\npsychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly\npolygenic,\n[186][187][188][189][190] \nwhere a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic\nvariants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the\ndisorder. Active research continues to work toward understanding the genetic and environmental bases of\nbehavior and their interaction.\nPsychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes\nand behavior.\nPsychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200\nBC, in the examinations for the Chinese civil service. Written\nexams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200). By\n1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests,\ninvolving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The\nsystem was ended in 1906.\n[191]: 41–2 \nIn Europe, mental assessment\ntook a different approach, with theories of physiognomy—\njudgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in\n4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the\nEnlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of\nmind and intelligence based on simple assessment of\nneuroanatomy.\n[191]: 42–3\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton\nwas a leading practitioner. By virtue of his procedures for\nmeasuring reaction time and sensation, he is considered an inventor\nof modern mental testing (also known as \npsychometrics\n).\n[191]: 44–5\nJames McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the\nidea of psychological testing to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".\n[191]: 45–6 \nIn\n1901, Cattell's student Clark Wissler published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of\nColumbia and Barnard students failed to predict academic performance.\n[191]: 45–6 \nIn response to 1904\norders from the Minister of Public Instruction, One example of an observational study was run by Arthur\nBandura. This observational study focused on children who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive\nbehaviors and their reaction to toys versus other children who were not exposed to these stimuli. The result\nApplications\nPsychological testing\n\nshows that children who had seen the adult acting aggressively towards a toy, in turn, were aggressive\ntowards their own toy when put in a situation that frustrated them.\n[192] \npsychologists Alfred Binet and\nThéodore Simon developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911. They used a range of\nquestions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and\nreferred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots. Henry H. Goddard put the Binet-Simon scale to work\nand introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feebleminded. In 1916, (after Binet's\ndeath), Stanford professor Lewis M. Terman modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the Stanford–Binet\nscale) and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report.\n[191]: 50–56 \nBased on his test findings, and\nreflecting the racism common to that era, Terman concluded that intellectual disability \"represents the level\nof intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest\nand also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial.\"\n[193]\nFollowing the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests, which was developed by psychologist Robert Yerkes in\n1917 and then used in World War 1 by industrial and organizational psychologists for large-scale employee\ntesting and selection of military personnel.\n[194] \nMental testing also became popular in the U.S., where it\nwas applied to schoolchildren. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7\nmillion children in the 1920s. In 1926, the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic\nAptitude Test to standardize college admissions.\n[191]: 61 \nThe results of intelligence tests were used to argue\nfor segregated schools and economic functions, including the preferential training of Black Americans for\nmanual labor. These practices were criticized by Black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison\nDavis.\n[193] \nEugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals\nclassified as mentally retarded (now referred to as \nintellectual disability\n).\n[46] \nIn the United States, tens of\nthousands of men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent that has never been overturned, the U.S.\nSupreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1927 case \nBuck v. Bell\n.\n[195]\nToday mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies.\n[191]: 2 \nModern\ntesting aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, consistency of results, output of an\ninterpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, effective prediction of\nbehavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.\n[191]: 4–6 \nPsychological testing is regularly used in\nforensic contexts to aid legal judgments and decisions.\n[196] \nDevelopments in psychometrics include work\non test and scale reliability and validity.\n[197] \nDevelopments in item-response theory,\n[198] \nstructural equation\nmodeling,\n[199] \nand bifactor analysis\n[200] \nhave helped in strengthening test and scale construction.\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S.\nSometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in\npractices that resemble that of clinical psychologists. Clinical psychologists typically include people who\nhave graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology. In Canada, some of the members of the\nabovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology. In Canada and\nthe U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually\nspend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship. In Mexico and most\nother Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees;\ninstead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.\n[91] \nClinical psychology is at\npresent the largest specialization within psychology.\n[201] \nIt includes the study and application of psychology\nfor the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or\nmental illness. Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growth. Central\nMental health care\n\nto the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical\npsychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program\ndevelopment and administration.\n[202]\nCredit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established\nhis practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince, an early advocate\nfor the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline.\n[201] \nIn the first part of the\ntwentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists, who are\nmedical doctors. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to\nimprove the diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using\npsychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally\nill.\n[41][203]\nPsychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology,\nand this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities. Some in the clinical psychology\ncommunity adopted behavioral therapy, a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model that used behaviorist\nlearning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of\nthe treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, cognitive-behavior therapy emerged with the work of Albert\nEllis and Aaron Beck. Although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive-behavior\ntherapy, cognitive-behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs. Since the 1970s, the\npopularity of cognitive-behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased. A key practice in\nbehavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise\nthat their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.\n[204]\nMental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbers. In 1977,\nNational Institute of Mental Health director Bertram Brown described this shift as a source of \"intense\ncompetition and role confusion.\"\n[41] \nGraduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged\nin the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. The PhD degree is intended to train\npractitioners who could also conduct scientific research. The PsyD degree is more exclusively designed to\ntrain practitioners.\n[91]\nSome clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury. This\nsubspecialty is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated\nmental health profession. The emerging field of disaster psychology (see crisis intervention) involves\nprofessionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.\n[205]\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all\nof which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple,\nfamily, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.\nFour major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and\nsystems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic\napproaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and\nsexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is\nevidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a\nstrong therapeutic alliance.\n[206][207] \nBecause of this, more training programs and psychologists are now\nadopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation.\n[208][209][210][211][212]\n\nAn item from a cognitive abilities test\nused in educational psychology\nDiagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM).\n[213] \nThe study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology.\nEducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in\neducational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions,\nthe psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as\norganizations. Educational psychologists can be found in\npreschools, schools of all levels including post secondary\ninstitutions, community organizations and learning centers,\nGovernment or private research firms, and independent or private\nconsultant.\n[214] \nThe work of developmental psychologists such as\nLev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner has been influential\nin creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational\npsychology is often included in teacher education programs in\nplaces such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\nSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand\nand treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students; to facilitate\nprosocial behaviors in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning\nenvironments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention,\nprevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.\n[215]\nIndustrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological\ntheories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-lives.\n[216] \nIn the field's beginnings,\nindustrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management\ntechniques for improving workplace efficiency. The field was at first called economic psychology or\nbusiness psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology.\n[217] \nAn\ninfluential early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from\n1924 to 1932. Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in\nillumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation\nitself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people's behavior can change\nwhen they think they are being observed.\n[218] \nAlthough the Hawthorne research can be found in\npsychology textbooks, the research and its findings were weak at best.\n[219][220]\nThe name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the 1960s. In 1973, it became enshrined in\nthe name of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Division 14 of the American\nPsychological Association.\n[217] \nOne goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplace.\nPersonnel psychology is a subfield of I/O psychology. Personnel psychologists apply the methods and\nprinciples of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. Another subfield, organizational psychology,\nexamines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction,\nand productivity.\n[221] \nMost I/O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public\nEducation\nWork\n\norganizations and as consultants.\n[217] \nA psychology consultant working in business today might expect to\nprovide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, and the organization\nof their company.\n[222][223]\nOrganizational behavior (OB) is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within\norganizations.\n[224] \nOne way to differentiate I/O psychology from OB is that I/O psychologists train in\nuniversity psychology departments and OB specialists, in business schools.\nOne role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel. In\nthe U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military\nPsychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia. The school provided psychological training for military\nstaff.\n[41][225] \nToday, U.S. Army psychologists perform psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy,\nsuicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as provide prevention-related services,\nfor example, smoking cessation.\n[226] \nThe United States Army's Mental Health Advisory Teams implement\npsychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems.\n[227][228]\nPsychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare.\nPsychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians.\nThis so-called black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the\nArmy.\n[229] \nThe CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving\ntechniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD.\n[230] \nThe U.S. military\nused the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these activities were reclassified as\nMilitary Information Support Operations (MISO), part of Information Operations (IO).\n[231] \nPsychologists\nhave sometimes been involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, staining the records of\nthe psychologists involved.\n[232]\nAn example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and\nMamie Phipps Clark. These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse\npsychological impact on Black children. Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case\nBrown v. Board of Education \n(1954).\n[233]\nThe impact of psychology on social change includes the discipline's broad influence on teaching and\nlearning. Research has shown that compared to the \"whole word\" or \"whole language\" approach, the\nphonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious.\n[234]\nMedical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles. One aspect of health\npsychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health\npsychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.\n[235][236] \nPsychologists\nMilitary and intelligence\nHealth, well-being, and social change\nSocial change\nMedical applications\n\nin the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range\nfrom public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. Psychologists study the\ncomposite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people.\n[237]\nPsychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health\nand well-being of employees. Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific\nproblems, whereas others are full-time employees of the organization. Applications include conducting\nsurveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier. Some of the specific health\nareas include:\nAccidents and injuries: A major contribution is the concept of safety climate, which is\nemployee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged (e.g., wearing safety\ngear) and discouraged (not following safety rules) at work.\n[238] \nOrganizations with strong\nsafety climates have fewer work accidents and injuries.\n[239]\nCardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of job control.\n[240]\nMental health: Exposure to occupational stress is associated with mental health\ndisorder.\n[241]\nMusculoskeletal disorder: These are injuries in bones, nerves and tendons due to\noverexertion and repetitive strain. They have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace\nstress.\n[242]\nPhysical health symptoms: Occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such\nas digestive distress and headache.\n[243]\nWorkplace violence: Violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted\nand psychologically mistreated at work.\n[244]\nInterventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violence. Interventions that reduce\nstress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an\nimportant component.\nIndustrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during World War I, when government ministers\nin Britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types\nof factories.\n[245][246] \nIn the U. K. some interest in worker well-being emerged with the efforts of Charles\nSamuel Myers and his National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) during the inter-War years.\n[247] \nIn\nthe U. S. during the mid-twentieth century industrial psychologist Arthur Kornhauser pioneered the study of\noccupational mental health, linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of\nan unsatisfying job into a worker's personal life.\n[248][249] \nZickar accumulated evidence to show that \"no\nother industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that\nwould improve the lives of working people.\"\n[248]\nAs interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century, the field of occupational\nhealth psychology (OHP) emerged. OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary.\n[49][250] \nOHP is\nconcerned with the health and safety of workers.\n[49][250] \nOHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of\noccupational stressors on physical and mental health, mistreatment of workers (e.g., bullying and violence),\nwork-family balance, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, the influence\nof psychosocial factors on safety and accidents, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker\nWorker health, safety and wellbeing\nOccupational health psychology\n\nFlowchart of the four phases,\nenrollment, intervention allocation,\nfollow-up, and data analysis, of a\nparallel randomized trial of two\ngroups modified from the CONSORT\n2010 Statement\n[258]\nhealth.\n[49][251] \nOHP grew out of health\n psychology,\n \nindustrial and organizational psychology,\n and\noccupational medicine.\n[252] \nOHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology, including\nindustrial engineering, sociology, and economics.\n[253][254]\nQuantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field\nmakes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can\nonly assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled,\nbut more ecologically valid, field experiments as well. Other research psychologists rely on statistical\nmethods to glean knowledge from population data.\n[255] \nThe statistical methods research psychologists\nemploy include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear\nregression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The\nmeasurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs.\nAlthough this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research, some\npsychologists conduct qualitative research. This type of research can involve interviews, questionnaires, and\nfirst-hand observation.\n[256] \nWhile hypothesis testing is rare, virtually impossible, in qualitative research,\nqualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation, interpreting seemingly contradictory\nquantitative findings, and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed.\n[257]\nA true experiment with random assignment of research participants\n(sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to\nmake strong inferences about causal relationships. When there are\nlarge numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also\ncalled random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions\nensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be\nsimilar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went\nunmeasured. In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more\nvariables of influence, called independent variables, and measures\nresulting changes in the factors of interest, called dependent\nvariables. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a\nlaboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\nA quasi-experiment is a situation in which different conditions are\nbeing studied, but random assignment to the different conditions is\nnot possible. Investigators must work with preexisting groups of\npeople. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much\nthe nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validity.\n[260] \nFor\nexample, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school\nadministrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole\nlanguage classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments.\nPsychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and,\nperhaps, statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level.\nResearch methods\nControlled experiments\n\nThe experimenter (E) orders the\nteacher (T), the subject of the\nexperiment, to give what the latter\nbelieves are painful electric shocks\nto a learner (L), who is actually an\nactor and confederate. The subject\nbelieves that for each wrong answer,\nthe learner was receiving actual\nelectric shocks, though in reality\nthere were no such punishments.\nBeing separated from the subject,\nthe confederate set up a tape\nrecorder integrated with the electro-\nshock generator, which played pre-\nrecorded sounds for each shock\nlevel etc.\n[259]\nExperimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis\ntesting model which involves making predictions before conducting\nthe experiment, then assessing how well the data collected are\nconsistent with the predictions. These predictions are likely to\noriginate from one or more abstract scientific hypotheses about how\nthe phenomenon under study actually works.\n[261]\nSurveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring\nattitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, and checking the\nvalidity of experimental manipulations (checking research\nparticipants' perception of the condition they were assigned to).\nPsychologists have commonly used paper-and-pencil surveys.\nHowever, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-\nmail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently\nreach many subjects.\nObservational studies are commonly conducted in psychology. In\ncross-sectional observational studies, psychologists collect data at a\nsingle point in time. The goal of many cross-sectional studies is the\nassess the extent factors are correlated with each other. By contrast,\nin longitudinal studies psychologists collect data on the same\nsample at two or more points in time. Sometimes the purpose of\nlongitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the\nstability of traits or age-related changes in behavior. Because some\nstudies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study\nfrom an experimental standpoint, such as identifying the causes of\ndepression, they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of\ndepression-free people, periodically assessing what is happening in\nthe individuals' lives. In this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding\nconditions that commonly arise in people's lives that put them at risk for depression. Problems that affect\nlongitudinal studies include selective attrition, the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a\ncertain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a study.\nOne example of an observational study was run by Arthur Bandura. This observational study focused on\nchildren who were exposed to an adult exhibiting aggressive behaviors and their reaction to toys versus\nother children who were not exposed to these stimuli. The result shows that children who had seen the adult\nacting aggressively towards a toy, in turn, were aggressive towards their own toy when put in a situation\nthat frustrated them.\n[192]\nOther types of studies\n\nAn EEG recording setup\nArtificial neural network with two\nlayers, an interconnected group of\nnodes, akin to the vast network of\nneurons in the human brain\nExploratory data analysis includes a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many\nvariables to a small number overarching factors. In Peirce's three modes of inference, exploratory data\nanalysis corresponds to abduction.\n[262] \nMeta-analysis is the technique research psychologists use to\nintegrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the\nfindings.\n[263]\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity\nis the electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique using amplified\nelectrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in\ndifferent parts of the brain. Hans Berger, the first researcher to use\nEEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit\nsignature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to\ndifferent states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined\nstatistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified\nunique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during\nnon-REM sleep.\n[264]\nNewer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography,\nboth of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These\ntechnologies provide more localized information about activity in\nthe brain and create representations of the brain with widespread\nappeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems\nof subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard\nconclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—\nor even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality.\nHowever, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results\nshowing the existence of correlations between mind and brain.\nSome of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than\na localized function model.\n[265][266][267]\nInterventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs\nalso provide information about brain–mind interactions.\nPsychopharmacology is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\nComputational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate\nbehavior.\n[268] \nThis method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly,\nsimulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows\npsychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that could not be\nDirect brain observation/manipulation\nComputer simulation\n\nA rat undergoing a Morris water\nnavigation test used in behavioral\nneuroscience to study the role of the\nhippocampus in spatial learning and\nmemory\ndirectly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain.\nAnother method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules.\nOther types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human\npsychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and\nthought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan\nPavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning.\nNon-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, and rats and other\nrodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally,\ncontrolled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a\ntime, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent\nvariables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory\nsettings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds\nvary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult\nto control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls,\nhowever, in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans\nthrough animal models.\n[269]\nComparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals,\nespecially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior.\nResearch in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to\nother disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology.\n[270] \nResearch in comparative psychology\nsometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite\ncontroversial, for example the Sociobiology of E.O. Wilson.\n[271] \nAnimal models are often used to study\nneural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\nQualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of\nindividuals. Qualitative research involving first-hand observation can help describe events as they occur,\nwith the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and\nunderstanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made.\nQualitative psychological research methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant\nobservation. Creswell (2003) identified five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative,\nphenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. Qualitative researchers\n[273] \nsometimes aim\nto enrich our understanding of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic\nand critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's application of psychological and\nsociological theories, in his book Escape from Freedom, to understanding why many ordinary Germans\nsupported Hitler.\n[274]\nJust as Jane Goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee\nbehavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional,\nand family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the\nAnimal studies\nQualitative research\n\nPhineas P. Gage survived\nan accident in which a large\niron rod was driven\ncompletely through his\nhead, destroying much of\nhis brain's left frontal lobe,\nbut the injury altered his\npersonality and\nbehavior.\n[272]\nparticipants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines\nmust be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\nProgram evaluation involves the systematic collection, analysis, and\napplication of information to answer questions about projects, policies and\nprograms, particularly about their effectiveness.\n[275][276] \nIn both the public\nand private sectors, stakeholders often want to know the extent which the\nprograms they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting\nto are producing the intended effects. While program evaluation first focuses\non effectiveness, important considerations often include how much the\nprogram costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether\nthe program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are\nunintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and\nuseful.\n[277]\nMetascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself. The field of\nmetascience has revealed problems in psychological research. Some psychological research has suffered\nfrom bias,\n[278] \nproblematic reproducibility,\n[279] \nand misuse of statistics.\n[280] \nThese findings have led to\ncalls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community.\n[281]\nIn 1959, statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that\n97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying possible publication bias.\n[282][283][284] \nSimilarly,\nFanelli (2010)\n[285] \nfound that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were\nlooking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher\nthan in fields such as space science or geosciences. Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in \"softer\"\nsciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.\nA replication crisis in psychology has emerged. Many notable findings in the field have not been replicated.\nSome researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results.\n[286][287][288] \nSystematic efforts,\nincluding efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science, to assess the extent of the\nproblem found that as many as two-thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be\nreplicated.\n[289] \nReproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology (in studies and\njournals) than social psychology\n[289] \nand subfields of differential psychology.\n[290][291] \nOther subfields of\npsychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis, including clinical psychology,\n[292][293][294]\ndevelopmental psychology,\n[295][296][297] \nand a field closely related to psychology, \neducational\nresearch.\n[298][299][300][301][302]\nProgram evaluation\nContemporary issues\nMetascience\nConfirmation bias\nReplication\n\nFocus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to re-test important\nfindings.\n[303][304] \nIn response to concerns about publication bias and data dredging (conducting a large\nnumber of statistical tests on a great many variables but restricting reporting to the results that were\nstatistically significant), 295 psychology and medical journals have adopted result-blind peer review where\nstudies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed, but before the\nstudies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the\ntheoretical justifications for their proposed statistical analysis before data collection or analysis is\nconducted.\n[305][306] \nIn addition, large-scale collaborations among researchers working in multiple labs in\ndifferent countries have taken place. The collaborators regularly make their data openly available for\ndifferent researchers to assess.\n[307] \nAllen and Mehler\n[308] \nestimated that 61 per cent of result-blind studies\nhave yielded null results, in contrast to an estimated 5 to 20 per cent in traditional research.\nSome critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced. Psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen\nwrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance,\nenthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts.\n[309] \nSome psychologists have responded with\nan increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on p-values.\n[310]\nIn 2008, Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about\nU.S. populations when U.S. citizens are only 5% of the world's population. He complained that\npsychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research\nfindings to the rest of the global population.\n[311] \nIn 2010, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan reported a bias\nin conducting psychology studies with participants from \"WEIRD\" (\"Western, Educated, Industrialized,\nRich, and Democratic\") societies.\n[312][313] \nHenrich et al. found that \"96% of psychological samples come\nfrom countries with only 12% of the world's population\" (p. 63). The article gave examples of results that\ndiffer significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures, including the Müller-Lyer illusion.\nArnett (2008), Altmaier and Hall (2008) and Morgan-Consoli et al. (2018) view the Western bias in\nresearch and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological\nprinciples developed in WEIRD regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations\naround the world.\n[311][314][315] \nIn 2018, Rad, Martingano, and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after\nHenrich et al.'s paper, over 80% of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological\nScience employed WEIRD samples. Moreover, their analysis showed that several studies did not fully\ndisclose the origin of their samples; the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to\nreduce WEIRD bias.\n[316]\nSimilar to the WEIRD bias, starting in 2020, researchers of non-human behavior have started to emphasize\nthe need to document the possibility of the STRANGE (Social background, Trappability and self-selection,\nRearing history, Acclimation and habituation, Natural changes in responsiveness, Genetic makeup, and\nExperience) bias in study conclusions.\n[317]\nMisuse of statistics\nWEIRD bias\nSTRANGE bias\nUnscientific mental health training\n\nSome observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application\nof unsupported or unsound clinical practices.\n[318] \nCritics say there has been an increase in the number of\nmental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence.\n[319] \nPractices such as \"facilitated\ncommunication for infantile autism\"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other\ntherapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their\npopularity.\n[320] \nThese practices, however, are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology\ndoctoral programs.\nEthical standards in the discipline have changed over time. Some famous past studies are today considered\nunethical and in violation of established codes (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving\nHumans, and the Belmont Report). The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical\nprinciples and a code of conduct for the profession.\n[321]\nThe most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent. After World War II,\nthe Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most\ncountries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of Helsinki. In the U.S., the National Institutes of\nHealth established the Institutional Review Board in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act\n(HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human\nparticipants in experimental studies. A number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the\nestablishment of this rule; such studies included the MIT-Harvard Fernald School radioisotope studies, the\nThalidomide tragedy, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to\nauthority.\nUniversities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights (e.g., voluntary nature of participation\nin the research, privacy) and well-being (e.g., minimizing distress) of research participants. University ethics\ncommittees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well-being of\nparticipants; an investigator's research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics\ncommittee.\n[322]\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of\nPsychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has\nchanged multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on\nadvertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The\n1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\"\nones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with\nthe APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.\n[323]\nEthics\nHumans\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of\ncompetence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another\nimportant principle is informed consent, the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and\nfreely choose a procedure they are undergoing.\n[323] \nSome of the most common complaints against clinical\npsychologists include sexual misconduct.\n[323]\nResearch on other animals is governed by university ethics committees. Research on nonhuman animals\ncannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee, of the researcher's home institution. Ethical\nguidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm\n(physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.\n[324]\nPsychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\nComparative psychologist Harry Harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus\nmacaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s.\n[325] \nThe aim of the research was\nto produce an animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised what he called a \"rape rack\", to\nwhich the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.\n[326] \nIn 1974, American literary critic\nWayne C. Booth wrote that, \"Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates\ndecade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be\ndestroyed by destroying their social ties.\" He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the\nmorality of his work.\n[327]\nAnimal research is influential in psychology, while still being debated among academics. The testing of\nanimals for research has led to medical breakthroughs in human medicine. Many psychologists argue\nanimal experimentation is essential for human advancement, but must be regulated by the government to\nensure ethicality.\n1.

Hare\nlater re-popularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology\nwith his Psychopathy Checklist.\n[9][11][14][15]\nAlthough no psychiatric or psychological organization has\nsanctioned a diagnosis titled \"psychopathy\", assessments of\npsychopathic characteristics are widely used in criminal justice\nsettings in some nations and may have important consequences for\nindividuals. The study of psychopathy is an active field of research.\nThe term is also used by the general public, popular press, and in\nfictional portrayals.\n[15][16] \nWhile the abbreviated term \"psycho\" is\noften employed in common usage in general media along with\n\"crazy\", \"insane\", and \"mentally ill\", there is a categorical\ndifference between psychosis and psychopathy.\n[17]\nThe word psychopathy is a joining of the Greek words psyche\n(ψυχή) \"soul\" and pathos (πάθος) \"suffering, feeling\".\n[18] \nThe first\ndocumented use is from 1847 in Germany as psychopatisch,\n[19]\nand the noun psychopath has been traced to 1885.\n[20] \nIn medicine,\nHistory\nEtymology\n\nschizotypal\ndisorder, or\nschizoaffective\ndisorder\nPrevention Proper care of\nchildren\nTreatment Very few accepted\ntreatments. Use of\npsychotherapy is\naccepted, though\nbenefits are weak.\nMedication None\nPrognosis Poor\npatho- has a more specific meaning of disease (Thus pathology has\nmeant the study of disease since 1610, and psychopathology has\nmeant the study of mental disorder in general since 1847. A sense\nof \"a subject of pathology, morbid, excessive\" is attested from\n1845,\n[21] \nincluding the phrase \npathological liar \nfrom 1891 in the\nmedical literature).\nThe term psychopathy initially had a very general meaning\nreferring to all sorts of mental disorders and social aberrations,\npopularised from 1891 in Germany by Koch's concept of\n\"psychopathic inferiority\" (psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten).\nSome medical dictionaries still define psychopathy in both a\nnarrow and broad sense, such as MedlinePlus from the U.S.\nNational Library of Medicine.\n[22] \nOn the other hand, Stedman's\nMedical Dictionary defines \"psychopath\" only as a \"former\ndesignation\" for a person with an antisocial type of personality disorder.\n[23]\nThe term psychosis was also used in Germany from 1841, originally in a very general sense. The suffix\n-ωσις (-osis) meant in this case \"abnormal condition\". This term or its adjective psychotic would come to\nrefer to the more severe mental disturbances and then specifically to mental states or disorders characterized\nby hallucinations, delusions or in some other sense markedly out of touch with reality.\n[24]\nThe slang term psycho has been traced to a shortening of the adjective psychopathic from 1936, and from\n1942 as a shortening of the noun psychopath,\n[25] \nbut it is also used as shorthand for psychotic or crazed.\n[26]\nThe media usually uses the term psychopath to designate any criminal whose offenses are particularly\nabhorrent and unnatural, but that is not its original or general psychiatric meaning.\n[27]\nThe word element socio- has been commonly used in compound words since around 1880.\n[28][29] \nThe term\nsociopathy may have been first introduced in 1909 in Germany by biological psychiatrist Karl Birnbaum\nand in 1930 in the US by educational psychologist George E. Partridge, as an alternative to the concept of\npsychopathy.\n[28] \nIt was used to indicate that the defining feature is violation of social norms, or antisocial\nbehavior, and may be social or biological in origin.\n[30][31][32][33]\nThe terms sociopathy and psychopathy were once used interchangeably in relation to antisocial personality\ndisorder; sociopathy is now outdated and is not a scientific term.\n[34] \nPsychopathy, however, is a well\ndocumented and well defined construct in the scientific literature.\n[35] \nThere are many psychopathic\npersonality traits; there are no 'sociopathic traits'. Furthermore, the DSM-5 introduced the dimensional\nmodel of personality disorders in Section III, which includes a specifier for diagnosing psychopathy.\n[36]\nAccording to the DSM, primary psychopathy is diagnosed when an individual meets criteria for both\nAntisocial Personality Disorder + it's Psychopathic Features Specifier.\n[37] \nThe Psychopathic Features\nSpecifier has been modeled on Factor 1 of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory, known as Fearless\nDominance. This explicates Psychopathy as not being a more extreme version of ASPD, but as an emergent\ncompound trait that manifests when Antisocial Personality Disorder is present in combination with high\nSociopathy\n\nlevels of Fearless Dominance (or Boldness as it's known in the Triarchic Model).\n[38] \nAnalyses showed that\nthis Section III ASPD greatly outperformed Section II ASPD in predicting scores on Hare’s (2003)\nPsychopathy Checklist-Revised.\n[39]\nSection III ASPD including the 'Psychopathic Traits Specifier' can be seen on page 765 of the DSM-5 or\nPage 885 of the DSM-5-TR.\n[40]\nThe term is used in various ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book\nSnakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term\nsociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas\nin other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on its origins\nand determinants. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those who see the causes as due\nto social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy is preferred by those who believe that\nthere are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors.\n[5]\nHare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as lacking a sense of empathy or morality,\nbut sociopathy as only differing from the average person in the sense of right and wrong.\n[41][42]\nAncient writings that have been connected to psychopathic traits include Deuteronomy 21:18–21 (https://m\nechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0521.htm#18) and a description of an unscrupulous man by the Greek philosopher\nTheophrastus around 300 BC.\n[43]\nThe concept of psychopathy has been indirectly connected to the early 19th century work of Pinel (1801;\n\"mania without delirium\") and Pritchard (1835; \"moral insanity\"), although historians have largely\ndiscredited the idea of a direct equivalence.\n[44] \nPsychopathy originally described any illness of the mind,\nbut found its application to a narrow subset of mental conditions when it was used toward the end of the\n19th century by the German psychiatrist Julius Koch (1891) to describe various behavioral and moral\ndysfunction in the absence of an obvious mental illness or intellectual disability. He applied the term\npsychopathic inferiority (psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten) to various chronic conditions and character\ndisorders, and his work would influence the later conception of the personality disorder.\n[9][45]\nThe term psychopathic came to be used to describe a diverse range of dysfunctional or antisocial behavior\nand mental and sexual deviances, including at the time homosexuality. It was often used to imply an\nunderlying \"constitutional\" or genetic origin. Disparate early descriptions likely set the stage for modern\ncontroversies about the definition of psychopathy.\n[9]\nAn influential figure in shaping modern American conceptualizations of psychopathy was American\npsychiatrist Hervey Cleckley. In his classic monograph, The Mask of Sanity (1941), Cleckley drew on a\nsmall series of vivid case studies of psychiatric patients at a Veterans Administration hospital in Georgia to\nprovide a description for psychopathy. Cleckley used the metaphor of the \"mask\" to refer to the tendency of\npsychopaths to appear confident, personable, and well-adjusted compared to most psychiatric patients,\nwhile revealing underlying pathology through their actions over time. Cleckley formulated sixteen criteria\nfor psychopathy.\n[9] \nThe Scottish psychiatrist David Henderson had also been influential in Europe from\n1939 in narrowing the diagnosis.\n[46]\nPrecursors\n20th century\n\nPsychopaths are social predators who charm, manipulate, and\nruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of\nbroken hearts, shattered expectations, and empty wallets.\nCompletely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others,\nthey selfishly take what they want and do as they please,\nviolating social norms and expectations without the slightest\nsense of guilt or regret.\n—Robert D. Hare, 1993, p. xi\n[55]\nThe diagnostic category of sociopathic personality in early editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual (DSM)\n[47] \nhad some key similarities to Cleckley's ideas, though in 1980 when renamed Antisocial\nPersonality Disorder some of the underlying personality assumptions were removed.\n[11] \nIn 1980, Canadian\npsychologist Robert D. Hare introduced an alternative measure, the \"Psychopathy Checklist\" (PCL) based\nlargely on Cleckley's criteria, which was revised in 1991 (PCL-R),\n[48][49] \nand is the most widely used\nmeasure of psychopathy.\n[50] \nThere are also several self-report tests, with the Psychopathic Personality\nInventory (PPI) used more often among these in contemporary adult research.\n[9]\nFamous individuals have sometimes been diagnosed, albeit at a distance, as psychopaths. As one example\nout of many possible from history, in a 1972 version of a secret report originally prepared for the Office of\nStrategic Services in 1943, and which may have been intended to be used as propaganda,\n[51][52] \nnon-\nmedical psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer suggested Adolf Hitler was probably a psychopath.\n[53] \nHowever,\nothers have not drawn this conclusion; clinical forensic psychologist Glenn Walters argues that Hitler's\nactions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as, although he showed several characteristics of\ncriminality, he was not always egocentric, callously disregarding of feelings or lacking impulse control, and\nthere is no proof he could not learn from mistakes.\n[54]\nThere are multiple conceptualizations\nof psychopathy,\n[9] \nincluding\nCleckleyan psychopathy (Hervey\nCleckley's conception entailing bold,\ndisinhibited behavior, and \"feckless\ndisregard\") and criminal\npsychopathy (a meaner, more\naggressive and disinhibited\nconception explicitly entailing\npersistent and sometimes serious\ncriminal behavior). The latter\nconceptualization is typically used as\nthe modern clinical concept and assessed by the Psychopathy Checklist.\n[9] \nThe label \"psychopath\" may\nhave implications and stigma related to decisions about punishment severity for criminal acts, medical\ntreatment, civil commitments, etc. Efforts have therefore been made to clarify the meaning of the term.\n[9]\nIt has been suggested that those who share the same emotional deficiencies and psychopathic features, but\nare properly socialized, should not be designated as 'psychopaths'.\n[56]\nThe triarchic model\n[4] \nsuggests that different conceptions of psychopathy emphasize three observable\ncharacteristics to various degrees. Analyses have been made with respect to the applicability of\nmeasurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and Psychopathic Personality\nInventory (PPI) to this model.\n[4][9]\nDefinition\nConcepts\n\nBoldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and\nhigh self-confidence and social assertiveness. The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly\nand mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI fearless dominance. May correspond\nto differences in the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear.\n[4][9]\nDisinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking\naffect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints.\nSimilar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in\nfrontal lobe systems that are involved in such control.\n[4][9]\nMeanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close\nattachments, use of cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of\nauthority, and destructive excitement seeking. The PCL-R in general is related to this but in\nparticular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to PPI, but also includes elements of subscales\nin impulsive antisociality.\n[4][9]\nPsychopathy has been conceptualized as a hybrid condition marked by a paradoxical combination of\nsuperficial charm, poise, emotional resilience, and venturesomeness on the outside but deep-seated affective\ndisturbances and impulse control deficits on the inside. From this perspective, psychopathy is at least in part\ncharacterized by psychologically adaptive traits.\n[57] \nFurthermore, according to this view, psychopathy may\nbe linked to at least some interpersonally successful outcomes, such as effective leadership, business\naccomplishments, and heroism.\n[9][58][59][60]\nAn early and influential analysis from Harris and colleagues indicated that a discrete category, or taxon,\nmay underlie PCL-R psychopathy, allowing it to be measured and analyzed. However, this was only found\nfor the behavioral Factor 2 items they identified, child problem behaviors; adult criminal behavior did not\nsupport the existence of a taxon.\n[61] \nMarcus, John, and Edens more recently performed a series of statistical\nanalyses on PPI scores and concluded that psychopathy may best be conceptualized as having a\n\"dimensional latent structure\" like depression.\n[62]\nMarcus et al. repeated the study on a larger sample of prisoners, using the PCL-R and seeking to rule out\nother experimental or statistical issues that may have produced the previously different findings.\n[63] \nThey\nagain found that the psychopathy measurements do not appear to be identifying a discrete type (a taxon).\nThey suggest that while for legal or other practical purposes an arbitrary cut-off point on trait scores might\nbe used, there is actually no clear scientific evidence for an objective point of difference by which to label\nsome people \"psychopaths\"; in other words, a \"psychopath\" may be more accurately described as someone\nwho is \"relatively psychopathic\".\n[9]\nThe PCL-R was developed for research, not clinical forensic diagnosis, and even for research purposes to\nimprove understanding of the underlying issues, it is necessary to examine dimensions of personality in\ngeneral rather than only a constellation of traits.\n[9][64]\nStudies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such as antagonism (high), conscientiousness\n(low) and anxiousness (low).\n[65]\nMeasurement\nPersonality dimensions\n\nPsychopathy has also been linked to high psychoticism—a theorized dimension referring to tough,\naggressive or hostile tendencies. Aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of\nsocialization and responsibility, impulsivity, sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression.\n[66][67][68]\nOtto Kernberg, from a particular psychoanalytic perspective, believed psychopathy should be considered as\npart of a spectrum of pathological narcissism, that would range from narcissistic personality on the low end,\nmalignant narcissism in the middle, and psychopathy at the high end.\n[68]\nPsychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism, three personality traits that are together referred to as the\ndark triad, share certain characteristics, such as a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.\n[69] \nThe dark\ntetrad refers to these traits with the addition of sadism.\n[70][71][72][73][74][75] \nSeveral psychologists have\nasserted that subclinical psychopathy and Machiavellianism are more or less interchangeable.\n[76] \nThere is a\nsubscale on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) dubbed \"Machiavellian Egocentricity\".\n[77][78]\nDelroy Paulhus has asserted that the difference that most miss is that while both are characterized by\nmanipulativeness and unemotionality, psychopaths tend to be more reckless.\n[79] \nOne study asserted that\n\"the ability to adapt, reappraise and reassess a situation may be key factors differentiating Machiavellianism\nfrom psychopathy, for example\".\n[80] \nPsychopathy and machiavellianism were also correlated similarly in\nresponses to affective stimuli, and both are negatively correlated with recognition of facial emotions.\n[81][82]\nMany have suggested merging the dark triad traits (especially Machiavellianism and psychopathy) into one\nconstruct, given empirical studies which show immense overlap.\n[83]\nThe current conceptions of psychopathy have been criticized for being poorly conceptualized, highly\nsubjective, and encompassing a wide variety of underlying disorders. Dorothy Otnow Lewis has written:\nThe concept and subsequent reification of the diagnosis \"psychopathy\" has, to this author's mind,\nhampered the understanding of criminality and violence. [...] According to Hare, in many cases\none need not even meet the patient. Just rummage through his records to determine what items\nseemed to fit. Nonsense. To this writer's mind, psychopathy and its synonyms (e.g., sociopathy\nand antisocial personality) are lazy diagnoses. Over the years the authors' team has seen scores of\noffenders who, prior to evaluation by the authors, were dismissed as psychopaths or the like.\nDetailed, comprehensive psychiatric, neurological, and neuropsychological evaluations have\nuncovered a multitude of signs, symptoms, and behaviors indicative of such disorders as bipolar\nmood disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, complex partial seizures, dissociative identity\ndisorder, parasomnia, and, of course, brain damage/dysfunction.\n[84]\nHalf of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist consists of symptoms of mania, hypomania, and frontal-lobe\ndysfunction, which frequently results in underlying disorders being dismissed.\n[85] \nHare's conception of\npsychopathy has also been criticized for being reductionist, dismissive, tautological, and ignorant of context\nas well as the dynamic nature of human behavior.\n[86] \nSome have called for rejection of the concept\naltogether, due to its vague, subjective and judgmental nature that makes it prone to misuse.\n[87] \nA systematic\nreview determined that the PCL is weakly predictive of criminal behavior, but not of lack of conscience, or\ntreatment and rehabilitation outcomes. These findings contradict widespread beliefs amongst professionals\nin forensics.\n[88]\nCriticism of current conceptions\n\nPsychopathic individuals do not show regret or remorse. This was thought to be due to an inability to\ngenerate this emotion in response to negative outcomes. However, in 2016, people with antisocial\npersonality disorder and dissocial personality disorder were found to experience regret, but did not use the\nregret to guide their choice in behavior. There was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range\nof potential actions and estimating the outcome values.\n[89]\nIn an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio\nR. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack\nthe ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas,\nthese brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-the-means\" answers, leading Damasio to\nconclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted\nby a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it\nhits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with\ntypically functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of\nSouthern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges\nimmoral people: \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying\nexclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean\nthey should be held to different standards of accountability?\"\n[90]\nSocially, psychopathy typically involves extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no\nregard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence. Mentally,\nimpairments in processes related to affect and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have\nalso been found. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with\nconduct disorder, and suggests at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.\n[91]\nDisagreement exists over which features should be considered as part of psychopathy, with researchers\nidentifying around 40 traits supposedly indicative of the construct,\n[92][93] \nthough the following\ncharacteristics are almost universally considered central.\nCooke and Michie (2001)\n[94] \nproposed a three-factor model of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised which\nhas seen widespread application in other measures (e.g. Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory,\n[95] \nAntisocial\nProcess Screening Device\n[96]\n).\nArrogant and deceitful interpersonal style: impression management or superficial charm,\ninflated and grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying/deceit, and manipulation for\npersonal gain.\nDeficient affective experience: lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect (coldness and\nunemotionality), callousness and lack of empathy, and failure to accept responsibility for own\nactions.\nImpulsive and irresponsible lifestyle: impulsivity, sensation-seeking and risk-taking,\nirresponsible and unreliable behavior, financially parasitic lifestyle and lack of realistic, long-\nSigns and symptoms\nPrimary features\nCore traits\n\nPsychopathy is strongly correlated\nwith crime, violence, and antisocial\nbehavior.\nterm goals.\nCleckley's (1941) original description of psychopathy included the absence of nervousness and neurotic\ndisorders, and later theorists referred to psychopaths as fearless or thick-skinned.\n[97] \nWhile it is often\nclaimed that the PCL-R does not include low anxiety or fearlessness, such features do contribute to the\nscoring of the Facet 1 (interpersonal) items, mainly through self-assurance, unrealistic optimism, brazenness\nand imperturbability.\n[98] \nIndeed, while self-report studies have been inconsistent using the two-factor model\nof the PCL-R, studies which separate Factor 1 into interpersonal and affective facets, more regularly show\nmodest associations between Facet 1 and low anxiety, boldness and fearless dominance (especially items\nassessing glibness/charm and grandiosity).\n[99][100][18] \nWhen both psychopathy and low anxiety/boldness\nare measured using interviews, both interpersonal and affective facets are both associated with fearlessness\nand lack of internalizing disorders.\n[20][21][22]\nThe importance of low anxiety/fearlessness to psychopathy has historically been underscored through\nbehavioral and physiological studies showing diminished responses to threatening stimuli (interpersonal and\naffective facets both contributing).\n[23] \nHowever, it is not known whether this is reflected in reduced\nexperience of state fear or where it reflects impaired detection and response to threat-related stimuli.\n[31]\nMoreover, such deficits in threat responding are known to be reduced or even abolished when attention is\nfocused on the threatening stimuli.\nIn terms of simple correlations, the PCL-R manual states an average\nscore of 22.1 has been found in North American prisoner samples,\nand that 20.5% scored 30 or higher. An analysis of prisoner samples\nfrom outside North America found a somewhat lower average value\nof 17.5. Studies have found that psychopathy scores correlated with\nrepeated imprisonment, detention in higher security, disciplinary\ninfractions, and substance misuse.\n[101][102]\nPsychopathy, as measured with the PCL-R in institutional settings,\nshows in meta-analyses small to moderate effect sizes with\ninstitutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent\ncrime with similar effects for the three outcomes. Individual studies\ngive similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples,\ncommunity samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to\nmoderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal\nhistory, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held\nto be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For\nexample, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to\ncrime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated\nmore strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a\nwhole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past\nLow anxiety and fearlessness\nOffending\nCriminality\n\ncriminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past\ncriminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of\npsychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.\n[9][103]\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and violence, and the PCL-R\nemphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior. Researchers, however, have noted\nthat psychopathy is dissociable from and not synonymous with violence.\n[9][104][105]\nIt has been suggested that psychopathy is associated with \"instrumental aggression\", also known as\npredatory, proactive, or \"cold blooded\" aggression, a form of aggression characterized by reduced emotion\nand conducted with a goal differing from but facilitated by the commission of harm.\n[106][107] \nOne\nconclusion in this regard was made by a 2002 study of homicide offenders, which reported that the\nhomicides committed by homicidal offenders with psychopathy were almost always (93.3%) primarily\ninstrumental, significantly more than the proportion (48.4%) of those committed by non-psychopathic\nhomicidal offenders, with the instrumentality of the homicide also correlated with the total PCL-R score of\nthe offender as well as their scores on the Factor 1 \"interpersonal-affective\" dimension. However, contrary\nto the equating of this to mean exclusively \"in cold blood\", more than a third of the homicides committed by\npsychopathic offenders involved some component of emotional reactivity as well.\n[108] \nIn any case, FBI\nprofilers indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense, and some research supports\nthis, at least with regard to sexual offending. One study has found more serious offending by non-\npsychopathic offenders on average than by offenders with psychopathy (e.g. more homicides versus more\narmed robbery and property offenses) and another that the Affective facet of the PCL-R predicted reduced\noffense seriousness.\n[9]\nStudies on perpetrators of domestic violence find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy, with the\nprevalence estimated to be at around 15-30%. Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is\ncorrelated with Factor 1 of the PCL-R, which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and\nexploitative interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic\nabusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a\nlack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and\nsuggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e.\ninstrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to\nthe types of psychosocial interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.\n[107][109]\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to\nviolence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the\npoorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators\nof violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those\nconducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which\ncan predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier,\nquicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based\non data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these\nassessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term\nmanagement, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific\nViolence\n\nprobabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk\nassessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using\nit.\n[9][110][111][112][113][114][115]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that psychopathic behavior is consistent with traits common to\nsome serial killers, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control,\nand predatory behavior.\n[116] \nIt has also been found that the homicide victims of psychopathic offenders\nwere disproportionately female in comparison to the more equitable gender distribution of victims of non-\npsychopathic offenders.\n[108]\nPsychopathy has been associated with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is\ncorrelated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian\nmale federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not\nmore sexual offences.\n[117] \nFor child molesters, psychopathy was associated with more offences.\n[118] \nA\nstudy on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual\nmurderers, in which 84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that\n82.4% of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by\nself-report or evidence) compared to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1\nscores correlated significantly with sadistic violence.\n[119][120] \nDespite this, it is reported that offenders with\npsychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual offenders) are about 2.5 times more likely to be granted\nconditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders.\n[118]\nHildebrand and colleagues (2004) have uncovered an interaction between psychopathy and deviant sexual\ninterests, wherein those high in psychopathy who also endorsed deviant sexual interests were more likely to\nrecidivate sexually.\n[121] \nA subsequent meta-analysis has consolidated such a result.\n[122]\nIn considering the issue of possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non-offending\nparent and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be\nassessed on the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher, then they should be excluded from any consideration\nof being placed in a home with children under any circumstances.\n[123] \nThere is, however, increasing\nconcern that PCL scores are too inconsistent between different examiners, including in its use to evaluate\nsex offenders.\n[124]\nThe possibility of psychopathy has been associated with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes.\nTerrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as\nantisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and\nblame externalization.\n[125] \nHowever, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that\nsuch comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated\nterrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing\noneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral\ncontrols, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting\norganized terrorism.\n[126][127]\nSexual offending\nOther offending\n\nIt may be that a significant portion of people with psychopathy are socially successful and tend to express\ntheir antisocial behavior through more covert avenues such as social manipulation or white collar crime.\nSuch individuals are sometimes referred to as \"successful psychopaths\", and may not necessarily always\nhave extensive histories of traditional antisocial behavior as characteristic of traditional psychopathy.\n[128]\nThe PCL:YV is an adaptation of the PCL-R for individuals aged 13–18 years. It is, like the PCL-R, done\nby a trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records. The \"Antisocial\nProcess Screening Device\" (APSD) is also an adaptation of the PCL-R. It can be administered by parents\nor teachers for individuals aged 6–13 years. High psychopathy scores for both juveniles (as measured with\nthese instruments) and adults (as measured with the PCL-R and other measurement tools) have similar\nassociations with other variables, including similar ability in predicting violence and criminality.\n[9][129][130]\nJuvenile psychopathy may also be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger, hostility,\nanxiety, and depression.\n[9][131] \nPsychopathic traits in youth typically comprise three factors:\ncallous/unemotional, narcissism, and impulsivity/irresponsibility.\n[132][133]\nThere is positive correlation between early negative life events of the ages 0–4 and the emotion-based\naspects of psychopathy.\n[134] \nThere are moderate to high correlations between psychopathy rankings from\nlate childhood to early adolescence. The correlations are considerably lower from early- or mid-adolescence\nto adulthood. In one study most of the similarities were on the Impulsive- and Antisocial-Behavior scales.\nOf those adolescents who scored in the top 5% highest psychopathy scores at age 13, less than one third\n(29%) were classified as psychopathic at age 24. Some recent studies have also found poorer ability at\npredicting long-term, adult offending.\n[9][135]\nConduct disorder is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behavior in childhood and/or\nadolescence, and may be seen as a precursor to ASPD. Some researchers have speculated that there are two\nsubtypes of conduct disorder which mark dual developmental pathways to adult psychopathy.\n[9][136][137]\nThe DSM allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10 and adolescent onset at age 10 and\nlater. Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits\ninteracting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in\nTerrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime referred to as \"life-course- persistent\" antisocial behavior as\nwell as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with\nshort-term antisocial behavior.\n[9]\nIt has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated\nwith life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this\ncombination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a\nparticularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have\nADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of\nadults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the\ninterpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with\npsychopathy. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly\ncorresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.\n[9]\nChildhood and adolescent precursors\nConduct disorder\n\nThe DSM-5 includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a callous, unemotional\ninterpersonal style across multiple settings and relationships.\n[134] \nThe specifier is based on research which\nsuggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe\nform of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment. Proponents of different\ntypes/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy\nand increased boldness and/or meanness in the triarchic model.\n[9][138]\nDysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala regions of the brain have been associated with specific\nlearning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury,\nincluding damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such\nareas resembled \"psychopathic individuals\" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral\nknowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral\nreasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be\nunable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also\nimpair stimulus-reinforced learning in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People\nscoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have\nsignificantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their uncinate fasciculus—white matter connecting\nthe amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence from DT-MRI of breakdowns in the white matter\nconnections between these two important areas.\n[139][140][141]\nAlthough some studies have suggested inverse relationships between psychopathy and intelligence,\nincluding with regards to verbal IQ, Hare and Neumann state that a large literature demonstrates at most\nonly a weak association between psychopathy and IQ, noting that the early pioneer Cleckley included good\nintelligence in his checklist due to selection bias (since many of his patients were \"well educated and from\nmiddle-class or upper-class backgrounds\") and that \"there is no obvious theoretical reason why the disorder\ndescribed by Cleckley or other clinicians should be related to intelligence; some psychopaths are bright,\nothers less so\". Studies also indicate that different aspects of the definition of psychopathy (e.g.\ninterpersonal, affective (emotion), behavioral and lifestyle components) can show different links to\nintelligence, and the result can depend on the type of intelligence assessment (e.g. verbal, creative, practical,\nanalytical).\n[16][104][142][143]\nA large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues\nfrom other people, more precisely an impaired emotional empathy in the recognition of, and response to,\nfacial expressions, body gestures and vocal tones of fear, sadness, pain and happiness.\n[144][91] \nThis\nimpaired recognition and reduced autonomic responsiveness might be partly accounted for by a decreased\nactivation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions.\n[91] \nThe underlying biological surfaces for\nprocessing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than\nthose of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular\nemotions such as fear. The overall pattern of results across studies indicates that people diagnosed with\npsychopathy demonstrate reduced MRI, fMRI, aMRI, PET, and SPECT activity in areas of the brain.\n[145]\nResearch has also shown that an approximate 18% smaller amygdala size contributes to a significantly\nMental traits\nCognition\nEmotion recognition and empathy\n\nlower emotional sensation in regards to fear, sadness, amongst other negative emotions, which may likely\nbe the reason as to why psychopathic individuals have lower empathy.\n[146] \nSome recent fMRI studies have\nreported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and\nnegatives).\n[147][148][149][150][151] \nStudies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such\nassociations.\n[151][152][153][154][155][156] \nMeta-analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both\nvocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults\nand children/adolescents.\n[156]\nPsychopathy has been associated with amorality—an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for\nmoral beliefs. There are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment. Studies of developmental level\n(sophistication) of moral reasoning found all possible results—lower, higher or the same as non-\npsychopaths. Studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of\nbreaking conventional rules or laws found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-\npsychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less severe.\n[157]\nA study comparing judgments of whether personal or impersonal harm would be endorsed in order to\nachieve the rationally maximum (utilitarian) amount of welfare found no significant differences between\nsubjects high and low in psychopathy. However, a further study using the same tests found that prisoners\nscoring high on the PCL were more likely to endorse impersonal harm or rule violations than non-\npsychopathic controls were. The psychopathic offenders who scored low in anxiety were also more willing\nto endorse personal harm on average.\n[157]\nAssessing accidents, where one person harmed another unintentionally, psychopaths judged such actions to\nbe more morally permissible. This result has been considered a reflection of psychopaths' failure to\nappreciate the emotional aspect of the victim's harmful experience.\n[158]\nBehavioral genetic studies have identified potential genetic and non-genetic contributors to psychopathy,\nincluding influences on brain function. Proponents of the triarchic model believe that psychopathy results\nfrom the interaction of genetic predispositions and an adverse environment. What is adverse may differ\ndepending on the underlying predisposition: for example, it is hypothesized that persons having high\nboldness may respond poorly to punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments.\n[4][9]\nGenetically informed studies of the personality characteristics typical of individuals with psychopathy have\nfound moderate genetic (as well as non-genetic) influences. On the PPI, fearless dominance and impulsive\nantisociality were similarly influenced by genetic factors and uncorrelated with each other. Genetic factors\nmay generally influence the development of psychopathy while environmental factors affect the specific\nMoral judgment\nCause\nGenetic\n\nFrom accidents such as the\none of Phineas Gage, it is\nknown that the prefrontal\ncortex plays an important\nrole in moral behavior.\nexpression of the traits that predominate. A study on a large group of children found more than 60%\nheritability for \"callous-unemotional traits\" and that conduct disorder among children with these traits has a\nhigher heritability than among children without these traits.\n[9][142][159]\nA study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age\n8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the\nPCL:SV at age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted\nparent, being physically neglected, low involvement of the father with the\nboy, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other\nsignificant factors included poor supervision, abuse, harsh discipline, large\nfamily size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social\nclass, and poor housing.\n[160] \nThere has also been association between\npsychopathy and detrimental treatment by peers.\n[5] \nHowever, it is difficult\nto determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development\nof psychopathy because of evidence of its strong heritability.\n[161]\nResearchers have linked head injuries with psychopathy and violence.\nSince the 1980s, scientists have associated traumatic brain injury, such as\ndamage to the prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex, with\npsychopathic behavior and a deficient ability to make morally and socially\nacceptable decisions, a condition that has been termed \"acquired\nsociopathy\", or \"pseudopsychopathy\".\n[148] \nIndividuals with damage to the\narea of the prefrontal cortex known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex show remarkable similarities to\ndiagnosed psychopathic individuals, displaying reduced autonomic response to emotional stimuli, deficits in\naversive conditioning, similar preferences in moral and economic decision making, and diminished empathy\nand social emotions like guilt or shame.\n[162] \nThese emotional and moral impairments may be especially\nsevere when the brain injury occurs at a young age. Children with early damage in the prefrontal cortex\nmay never fully develop social or moral reasoning and become \"psychopathic individuals ... characterized\nby high levels of aggression and antisocial behavior performed without guilt or empathy for their victims\".\nAdditionally, damage to the amygdala may impair the ability of the prefrontal cortex to interpret feedback\nfrom the limbic system, which could result in uninhibited signals that manifest in violent and aggressive\nbehavior.\n[139][150]\nThe influence of childhood trauma on the development of psychopathy in adulthood remains an active\nresearch question. According to Hervey M. Cleckley, a psychopathic person is someone who is able to\nimitate a normal functioning person, while masking or concealing their lack of internal personality structure.\nThis results in an internal disorder with recurrent deliberate and detrimental conduct. Despite presenting\nthemselves as serious, bright, and charming, psychopathic people are unable to experience true emotions.\nRobert Hare's two factor model and Christopher Patrick's triarchic model have both been developed to\nbetter understand psychopathy; however, whether the root cause is primarily environmental or primarily\ngenetic is still in question.\nEnvironment\nBrain injury\nChildhood trauma\n\nPsychopathy is a personality disorder of affective, interpersonal, and behavioral dimensions that begins in\nchildhood and manifests as aggressive actions in early or late adolescence. Childhood trauma affects\nvulnerability to different forms of psychopathology and traits associated with it. Parental behaviors such as\nrejection, abuse, neglect or over protection show some relationship with the development of detrimental\npsychopathic traits. Disinhibition mediates the relationship between physical abuse and two components of\npsychopathy (social deviation and affective interpersonal). Sexual abuse is directly correlated with the social\ndeviation factor, and physical abuse is directly correlated with the affective interpersonal factor.\n[163] \nGender\ndifferences have also been observed in psychopathy. For example, psychopathic antisocial personality traits\nare more noticeable in males while histrionic personality traits are more evident in females. In addition,\nwomen are more likely to experience internalizing psychopathology than men\n[164] \nand males may exhibit a\nstronger association between boldness and the experience of neglect as a child, as well as between\nmeanness and the experience of childhood maltreatment.\nPsychopathy is associated with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of disability and\ndeath due to factors such as violence, accidents, homicides, and suicides. This, in combination with the\nevidence for genetic influences, is evolutionarily puzzling and may suggest that there are compensating\nevolutionary advantages, and researchers within evolutionary psychology have proposed several\nevolutionary explanations. According to one hypothesis, some traits associated with psychopathy may be\nsocially adaptive, and psychopathy may be a frequency-dependent, socially parasitic strategy, which may\nwork as long as there is a large population of altruistic and trusting individuals, relative to the population of\npsychopathic individuals, to be exploited.\n[159][165] \nIt is also suggested that some traits associated with\npsychopathy such as early, promiscuous, adulterous, and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive\nsuccess.\n[159][165][166] \nRobert Hare has stated that many psychopathic males have a pattern of mating with\nand quickly abandoning women, and thereby have a high fertility rate, resulting in children that may inherit\na predisposition to psychopathy.\n[9][5][167]\nCriticism includes that it may be better to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat\npsychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability. Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the\ncombined effects of a very large number of adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small\neffect that it escapes natural selection.\n[9][159] \nThe personality is thought to be influenced by a very large\nnumber of genes and may be disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be a product of\na high mutation load.\n[159] \nPsychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or\nside-effect, of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself.\n[165][168]\nSome laboratory research demonstrates correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to\naversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that\ncause punishment, as well as low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin\nconductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While it has been\nargued that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to\nOther theories\nEvolutionary explanations\nMechanisms\nPsychological\n\nDysfunction of the orbitofrontal\ncortex, among other areas, is\nimplicated in the mechanism of\npsychopathy.\npleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also\nhad difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so.\n[169]\nThis may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings\nsuch as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research.\n[9] \nWhile\nestablishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain\nconditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.\n[170]\nThanks to advancing MRI studies, experts are able to visualize\nspecific brain differences and abnormalities of individuals with\npsychopathy in areas that control emotions, social interactions,\nethics, morality, regret, impulsivity and conscience within the brain.\nBlair, a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic\ntendencies stated, \"With regard to psychopathy, we have clear\nindications regarding why the pathology gives rise to the emotional\nand behavioral disturbance and important insights into the neural\nsystems implicated in this pathology\".\n[150] \nDadds et al., remarks\nthat despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is\nknown about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic\ndisconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.\n[171]\nA 2008 review by Weber et al. suggested that psychopathy is\nsometimes associated with brain abnormalities in prefrontal-\ntemporo-limbic regions that are involved in emotional and learning\nprocesses, among others.\n[172] \nNeuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences\nbetween those scoring high and low on the PCL-R in a 2011 review by Skeem et al. stating that they are\n\"most notably in the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate\ncortex, striatum, insula, and frontal and temporal cortex\".\n[9][173]\nThe amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important.\n[140] \nPeople scoring 25 or\nhigher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly\nreduced microstructural integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex\n(such as the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly\nrelated to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors.\n[141] \nFurthermore, changes in\nthe amygdala have been associated with \"callous-unemotional\" traits in children. However, the amygdala\nhas also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in\nparticular areas, which may be due to methodological issues.\n[9]\nSome of these findings are consistent with other research and theories. For example, in a neuroimaging\nstudy of how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words, widespread differences in\nactivation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared\nto \"normal\" volunteers, which is consistent with views in clinical psychology. Additionally, the notion of\npsychopathy being characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala,\nsince deficits in aversive conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala\ndysfunction, potentially compounded by orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction, although the specific reasons are\nunknown.\n[150][174]\nNeurological\n\nConsiderable research has documented the presence of the two subtypes of primary and secondary\npsychopathy.\n[175][176] \nProponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy distinction and triarchic model\nargue that there are neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their\nviews.\n[177] \nFor instance, the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued to be associated with reduced\nactivity in the amygdala during fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced startle response, while the\ndisinhibition factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that\nboldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable.\n[9]\nHigh levels of testosterone combined with low levels of cortisol and/or serotonin have been theorized as\ncontributing factors. Testosterone is \"associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear\nreduction\", and injecting testosterone \"shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity\", decreases\nfearfulness, and increases \"responding to angry faces\". Some studies have found that high testosterone\nlevels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone\nalone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy\ncorrelates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found that disruption of serotonin\nneurotransmission disrupts cortisol reactivity to a stress-inducing speech task. Thus, dysregulation of\nserotonin in the brain may contribute to the low cortisol levels observed in psychopathy. Cortisol increases\nwithdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in\nindividuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior.\nHigh testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with \"impulsive and highly\nnegative reactions\", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes\nfrustrated.\n[178] \nSeveral animal studies note the role of serotonergic functioning in impulsive aggression and\nantisocial behavior.\n[179][180][181][182]\nHowever, some studies on animal and human subjects have suggested that the emotional-interpersonal traits\nand predatory aggression of psychopathy, in contrast to impulsive and reactive aggression, is related to\nincreased \nserotoninergic functioning.\n[183][184][185][186] \nA study by Dolan and Anderson, regarding the\nrelationship between serotonin and psychopathic traits in a sample of personality disordered offenders,\nfound that serotonin functioning as measured by prolactin response, while inversely associated with\nimpulsive and antisocial traits, were positively correlated with arrogant and deceitful traits, and, to a lesser\nextent, callous and remorseless traits.\n[187] \nBariş Yildirim theorizes that the 5-HTTLPR \"long\" allele, which\nis generally regarded as protective against internalizing disorders, may interact with other serotoninergic\ngenes to create a hyper-regulation and dampening of affective processes that results in psychopathy's\nemotional impairments.\n[188] \nFurthermore, the combination of the 5-HTTLPR long allele and high\ntestosterone levels has been found to result in a reduced response to threat as measured by cortisol reactivity,\nwhich mirrors the fear deficits found in those with psychopathy.\n[189]\nStudies have suggested other correlations. Psychopathy was associated in two studies with an increased\nratio of HVA (a dopamine metabolite) to 5-HIAA (a serotonin metabolite).\n[178] \nStudies have found that\nindividuals with the traits meeting criteria for psychopathy show a greater dopamine response to potential\n\"rewards\" such as monetary promises or taking drugs such as amphetamines. This has been theoretically\nlinked to increased impulsivity.\n[190] \nA 2010 British study found that a large 2D:4D digit ratio, an indication\nof high prenatal estrogen exposure, was a \"positive correlate of psychopathy in females, and a positive\ncorrelate of callous affect (psychopathy sub-scale) in males\".\n[191]\nBiochemical\n\nFindings have also shown monoamine oxidase A to affect the predictive ability of the PCL-R.\n[192]\nMonoamine oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as\nserotonin and dopamine and are, therefore, capable of influencing feelings, mood, and behavior in\nindividuals.\n[193] \nFindings suggest that further research is needed in this area.\n[194][195]\nPsychopathy is most commonly assessed with the Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R), created by\nRobert D. Hare based on Cleckley's criteria from the 1940s, criminological concepts such as those of\nWilliam and Joan McCord, and his own research on criminals and incarcerated offenders in\nCanada.\n[142][196][197] \nThe PCL-R is widely used and is referred to by some as the \"gold standard\" for\nassessing psychopathy.\n[198] \nThere are nonetheless numerous criticisms of the PCL-R as a theoretical tool\nand in real-world usage.\n[199][200][201][202][203]\nUnlike the PCL, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) was developed to comprehensively index\npersonality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report\nscale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners,\nthough may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154\nitems organized into eight subscales.\n[204] \nThe item scores have been found to group into two overarching\nand largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality,\nplus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.\n[9] \nFactor 1 is\nassociated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may\nscore at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic\npersonality.\n[9]\nThe Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, otherwise known as the TriPM, is a 58-item, self-report assessment\nthat measures psychopathy within the three traits identified in the triarchic model: boldness, meanness and\ndisinhibition. Each trait is measured on separate subscales and added up resulting in a total psychopathy\nscore.\n[205]\nThe TriPM includes various components of other measures for assessing psychopathy, including meanness\nand disinhibition patterns within the psychopathic personality. However, there are differing approaches in\nthe measurement of the boldness construct.\n[206] \nThe boldness construct is used to highlighting the social\nand interpersonal implications of the psychopathic personality.\nDiagnosis\nTools\nPsychopathy Checklist\nPsychopathic Personality Inventory\nTriarchic Psychopathy Measure\nDSM and ICD\n\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying mental disorders—the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD) produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) produced by the American Psychiatric Association\n(APA).\n[207][208] \nBoth list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately\nconverged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although\nsignificant differences remain.\n[209]\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general\nterm that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \"antisocial reaction\" and\n\"dyssocial reaction\". The latter two eventually became antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in the DSM\nand dissocial personality disorder in the ICD. Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been\nreferred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual\nhas ever included a disorder officially titled as such.\n[9][11][14]\nThere are some traditional personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they\nassess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Psychopathic Deviate scale), California Psychological\nInventory (Socialization scale), and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Antisocial Personality Disorder\nscale. There is also the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report\nPsychopathy Scale (HSRP), but in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than\neither of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.\n[9]\nStudies suggest strong comorbidity between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. Among\nnumerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and histrionic,\nnarcissistic, borderline, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders, panic and obsessive–compulsive\ndisorders, but not neurotic disorders in general, schizophrenia, or depression.\n[102][210][211][212][213]\nFactor 1 and the boldness scale of psychopathy measurements are associated with narcissism and histrionic\npersonality disorder. This is due to a psychopath's cognitive and affective egocentrism. However, while a\nnarcissistic individual might view themselves as confident, they might seek out validation and attention from\nothers to validate their self-worth, whereas a psychopathic individual usually lacks such ambitions.\n[56]\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be highly comorbid with conduct disorder (a\ntheorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies. This may be explained\nin part by deficits in executive function.\n[210] \nAnxiety disorders often co-occur with ASPD, and contrary to\nassumptions, psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety; this appears to be related to items from\nFactor 2 but not Factor 1 of the PCL-R.\n[56] \nPsychopathy is also associated with \nsubstance use\ndisorders.\n[104][210][212][214][215]\nMichael Fitzgerald suggested overlaps between (primary) psychopathy and Asperger syndrome in terms of\nfearlessness, planning of acts, empathy deficits, callous behaviour, and sometimes superficial charisma.\n[216]\nStudies investigating similarities and differences between psychopathy and autism indicate that autism and\npsychopathy are not part of the same construct. Rather both conditions might co-occur in some\nindividuals.\n[217] \nRecent studies indicate that some individuals with an autism diagnosis also show callous\nOther tools\nComorbidity\n\nand unemotional traits (a risk-factor for developing psychopathy),\n[218] \nbut are less strongly associated with\nconduct problems.\n[219] \nLikewise, some people with an Asperger Syndrome Diagnosis have shown\ncorrelations with the \"unemotional\" factor and \"behavioural dyscontrol\" factor of psychopathy, but not the\n\"interpersonal\" factor.\n[220]\nIt has been suggested that psychopathy may be comorbid with several other conditions than these,\n[215] \nbut\nlimited work on comorbidity has been carried out. This may be partly due to difficulties in using inpatient\ngroups from certain institutions to assess comorbidity, owing to the likelihood of some bias in sample\nselection.\n[210]\nResearch on psychopathy has largely been done on men and the PCL-R was developed using mainly male\ncriminal samples, raising the question of how well the results apply to women. Men score higher than\nwomen on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be\nsomewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies\nhave found broadly similar factor structure for men and women.\n[9]\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was\nmore strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with openness to experience in\nwomen. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while in\nwomen it manifests more as a histrionic pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores\nmay be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women. On the other hand, psychopathy\nmay have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion\nis that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in\nwomen.\n[9] \nFurthermore, one study has suggested substantial gender differences were found in the etiology\nof psychopathy. For girls, 75% of the variance in severe callous and unemotional traits was attributable to\nenvironmental factors and just 0% of the variance was attributable to genetic factors. In boys, the link was\nreversed.\n[221]\nStudies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men, with one\nstudy reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to\n31 percent of violent males.\n[222] \nOther studies have also indicated that high psychopathic females are rare in\nforensic settings.\n[223]\nPsychopathy has often been considered untreatable. Its unique characteristics makes it among the most\nrefractory of personality disorders, a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered\ndifficult to treat.\n[224][225] \nPeople with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their\ncondition, and can be uncooperative in therapy.\n[198][224] \nAttempts to treat psychopathy with the current\ntools available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that\nthere is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as yet, no pharmacological\ntherapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of\nSex differences\nManagement\nClinical\n\npsychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become\nmore adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime.\n[226] \nSome\nstudies suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the\nbehavior of psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat.\n[226][227] \nThese failures\nhave led to a widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects, a view that is exacerbated by the little\nresearch being done into psychopathy compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses, which\nmakes it more difficult to gain the understanding of this condition that is necessary to develop effective\ntherapies.\n[228][229]\nAlthough the core character deficits of highly psychopathic individuals are likely to be highly incorrigible to\nthe currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be\nmore amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in\ncorrectional settings.\n[224] \nIt has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at\nreducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the\ntangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the\npatient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways.\n[230][231] \nTo this end, various therapies\nhave been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy,\nwith mixed success.\n[224] \nAs psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based\nmanagement, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and\nused to manage their behavior in institutional settings.\n[232]\nPsychiatric medications may also alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes associated with psychopathy\nor with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-\nstabilizing medications, although none have yet been approved by the FDA for this\npurpose.\n[9][11][14][233][234] \nFor example, a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in\nreducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high-security hospital inpatients with antisocial\npersonality disorder and psychopathic traits.\n[235] \nHowever, research into the pharmacological treatment of\npsychopathy and the related condition antisocial personality disorder is minimal, with much of the\nknowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental\ndisorders.\n[224][236]\nThe PCL-R, the PCL:SV, and the PCL:YV are highly regarded and widely used in criminal justice settings,\nparticularly in North America. They may be used for risk assessment and for assessing treatment potential\nand be used as part of the decisions regarding bail, sentence, which prison to use, parole, and regarding\nwhether a youth should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. There have been several criticisms against its\nuse in legal settings. They include the general criticisms against the PCL-R, the availability of other risk\nassessment tools which may have advantages, and the excessive pessimism surrounding the prognosis and\ntreatment possibilities of those who are diagnosed with psychopathy.\n[9]\nThe interrater reliability of the PCL-R can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in\napplied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the\nPCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in\none study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study it was\nestimated that of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to\nwhich side the rater testified for, and 30% was due to other rater differences.\n[9]\nLegal\n\nTo aid a criminal investigation, certain interrogation approaches may be used to exploit and leverage the\npersonality traits of suspects thought to have psychopathy and make them more likely to divulge\ninformation.\n[92]\nThe PCL-R score cut-off for a label of psychopathy is 25 out of 40 in the United Kingdom, instead of 30 as\nit is in the United States.\n[9][10]\nIn the United Kingdom, \"psychopathic disorder\" was legally defined in the Mental Health Act (UK), under\nMHA1983,\n[10][237] \nas \"a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including significant\nimpairment of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the\npart of the person concerned\". This term was intended to reflect the presence of a personality disorder in\nterms of conditions for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. Amendments to MHA1983 within the\nMental Health Act 2007 abolished the term \"psychopathic disorder\", with all conditions for detention (e.g.\nmental illness, personality disorder, etc.) encompassed by the generic term of \"mental disorder\".\n[93]\nIn England and Wales, the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder is grounds for detention in secure\npsychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act if they have committed serious crimes, but since such\nindividuals are disruptive to other patients and not responsive to usual treatment methods this alternative to\ntraditional incarceration is often not used.\n[238]\nStarting in the 1930s, before some modern concepts of psychopathy were developed, \"sexual psychopath\"\nlaws, the term referring broadly to mental illness, were introduced by some states, and by the mid-1960s\nmore than half of the states had such laws. Sexual offenses were considered to be caused by underlying\nmental illnesses, and it was thought that sex offenders should be treated, in agreement with the general\nrehabilitative trends at this time. Courts committed sex offenders to a mental health facility for community\nprotection and treatment.\n[94][239]\nStarting in 1970, many of these laws were modified or abolished in favor of more traditional responses such\nas imprisonment due to criticism of the \"sexual psychopath\" concept as lacking scientific evidence, the\ntreatment being ineffective, and predictions of future offending being dubious. There were also a series of\ncases where persons treated and released committed new sexual offenses. Starting in the 1990s, several\nstates have passed sexually dangerous person laws, including registration, housing restrictions, public\nnotification, mandatory reporting by health care professionals, and civil commitment, which permits\nindefinite confinement after a sentence has been completed.\n[239] \nPsychopathy measurements may be used\nin the confinement decision process.\n[9]\nThe prognosis for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, with some studies reporting\nthat treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates, though it\nis noted that one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n\"Sexual psychopath\" laws\nPrognosis\n\nretrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and\nlikely would not be approved of today.\n[9][198] \nHowever, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies\nusing more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and\nother criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials.\nVarious other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study\nhas yet examined whether the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy\ncould be changed by such treatments.\n[9][240]\nA 2008 study using the PCL:SV found that 1.2% of a US sample scored 13 or more out of 24, indicating\n\"potential psychopathy\". The scores correlated significantly with violence, alcohol use, and lower\nintelligence.\n[104] \nA 2009 British study by Coid et al., also using the PCL:SV, reported a community\nprevalence of 0.6% scoring 13 or more. However, if the scoring was adjusted to the recommended 18 or\nmore,\n[241] \nthis would have left the prevalence closer to 0.1%.\n[95] \nThe scores correlated with younger age,\nmale gender, suicide attempts, violence, imprisonment, homelessness, drug dependence, personality\ndisorders (histrionic, borderline and antisocial), and panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders.\n[242]\nPsychopathy has a much higher prevalence in the convicted and incarcerated population, where it is thought\nthat an estimated 15–25% of prisoners qualify for the diagnosis.\n[48] \nA study on a sample of inmates in the\nUK found that 7.7% of the inmates interviewed met the PCL-R cut-off of 30 for a diagnosis of\npsychopathy.\n[102] \nA study on a sample of inmates in Iran using the PCL:SV found a prevalence of 23%\nscoring 18 or more.\n[96] \nA study by Nathan Brooks from Bond University found that around one in five\ncorporate bosses display clinically significant psychopathic traits - a proportion similar to that among\nprisoners.\n[98]\nThere is limited research on psychopathy in the general work populace, in part because the PCL-R includes\nantisocial behavior as a significant core factor (obtaining a PCL-R score above the threshold is unlikely\nwithout having significant scores on the antisocial-lifestyle factor) and does not include positive adjustment\ncharacteristics, and most researchers have studied psychopathy in incarcerated criminals, a relatively\naccessible population of research subjects.\n[243]\nHowever, psychologists Fritzon and Board, in their study comparing the incidence of personality disorders\nin business executives against criminals detained in a mental hospital, found that the profiles of some senior\nbusiness managers contained significant elements of personality disorders, including those referred to as the\n\"emotional components\", or interpersonal-affective traits, of psychopathy. Factors such as boldness,\ndisinhibition, and meanness as defined in the triarchic model, in combination with other advantages such as\na favorable upbringing and high intelligence, are thought to correlate with stress immunity and stability, and\nmay contribute to this particular expression.\n[243] \nSuch individuals are sometimes referred to as \"successful\npsychopaths\" or \"corporate psychopaths\" and they may not always have extensive histories of traditional\nFrequency\nSociety and culture\nIn the workplace\n\ncriminal or antisocial behavior characteristic of the traditional conceptualization of psychopathy.\n[128] \nRobert\nHare claims that the prevalence of psychopathic traits is higher in the business world than in the general\npopulation, reporting that while about 1% of the general population meet the clinical criteria for\npsychopathy, figures of around 3–4% have been cited for more senior positions in business.\n[9][244][245]\nHare considers newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a \"corporate\npsychopath\".\n[55]\nAcademics on this subject believe that although psychopathy is manifested in only a small percentage of\nworkplace staff, it is more common at higher levels of corporate organizations, and its negative effects (for\nexample, increased bullying, conflict, stress, staff turnover, absenteeism, reduction in productivity) often\ncauses a ripple effect throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire corporate culture. Employees\nwith the disorder are self-serving opportunists, and may disadvantage their own organizations to further\ntheir own interests.\n[246] \nThey may be charming to staff above their level in the workplace hierarchy, aiding\ntheir ascent through the organization, but abusive to staff below their level, and can do enormous damage\nwhen they are positioned in senior management roles.\n[247][248] \nPsychopathy as measured by the PCL-R is\nassociated with lower performance appraisals among corporate professionals.\n[249] \nThe psychologist Oliver\nJames identifies psychopathy as one of the dark triadic traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism\nand Machiavellianism, which, like psychopathy, can have negative consequences.\n[250]\nAccording to a study from the University of Notre Dame published in the Journal of Business Ethics,\npsychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision, and are more likely to\nthrive under abusive bosses, being more resistant to stress, including interpersonal abuse, and having less of\na need for positive relationships than others.\n[251][99][100]\nCharacters with psychopathy or sociopathy are some of the most notorious characters in film and literature,\nbut their characterizations may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy as it is defined in\npsychiatry, criminology, and research. The character may be identified as having psychopathy within the\nfictional work itself, by its creators, or from the opinions of audiences and critics, and may be based on\nundefined popular stereotypes of psychopathy.\n[97] \nCharacters with psychopathic traits have appeared in\nGreek and Roman mythology, Bible stories, and some of Shakespeare's works.\n[43]\nSuch characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or\nantihero, where the general characteristics and stereotypes associated with psychopathy are useful to\nfacilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions, criteria, and popular conceptions throughout its\nhistory have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many of the characters characterized\nas psychopathic in notable works at the time of publication may no longer fit the current definition and\nconception of psychopathy. There are several archetypal images of psychopathy in both lay and\nprofessional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming con\nartist, the deranged serial killer and mass murderer, the callous and scheming businessperson, and the\nchronic low-level offender and juvenile delinquent. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of\nIn fiction\n\na mythical bogeyman, the disgust and intrigue surrounding evil, and fascination and sometimes perhaps\nenvy of people who might appear to go through life without attachments and unencumbered by guilt,\nanguish or insecurity.\n[9]\nCollective narcissism\nMoral psychology\nSerial rapist\nViolence and autism\n1. \"Psychopathic Personality and How It Develops | HealthyPlace\" (https://www.healthyplace.c\nom/personality-disorders/psychopath/psychopathic-personality-and-how-it-develops).\nwww.healthyplace.com.

(...) In Sweden, however, Nilsson and Soderstrom et al (2005)\nfound that the total PCL–R scores, as well as scores on the 'unemotionality' and 'behavioural\ndyscontrol' factors, were significantly correlated with high-functioning autistic traits. The\n'interpersonal' factor of the PCL–R showed none of these correlations, leading the authors to\nconclude that scores on this factor may capture features that are specific to psychopathy,\ndistinguishing core psychopathy from other diagnostic definitions.\"\n221.

Let me take a stab at summarizing the key points I'm picking up on:\n\nAt the highest level, human personality appears to be a complex interplay of biological, psychological and social factors. While there are common personality traits and dimensions that seem universal, the unique combination and expression of these traits in each individual is shaped by their genes, upbringing, life experiences, and cultural context. So personality has both universal and individual elements.\n\nSome notable personality constructs covered include:\n\n- The \"Big Five\" traits of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism which appear to be found across cultures\n- Psychopathy, characterized by lack of empathy, manipulativeness, impulsivity, and antisocial behavior. While often sensationalized, psychopathy occurs on a spectrum and is distinct from mental illnesses like psychosis.  \n- Developmental stages and changes in personality over the lifespan, from childhood temperament through the stability and changes of adulthood\n- Sex differences in the prevalence of certain personality traits and disorders\n- The interaction of personality with mental health and mental illness\n\nPhilosophically, the material also touches on age-old questions of how much personality is shaped by \"nature vs nurture\", the degree to which we have free will vs our behaviors being determined by factors outside our control, and the very definition of what constitutes a healthy or disordered personality.\n\nFrom a sociology perspective, understanding personality is crucial for grasping how individuals interact in social groups, organizations and institutions. Phenomena like leadership, group dynamics, and workplace culture are all influenced by the personalities of the people involved.\n\nSo in summary, personality is a endlessly complex topic that bridges the biological, psychological and social realms. By studying it from multiple angles, we gain insight into the universal experiences that unite humans as a species as well as the beautifully intricate patterns that make each person uniquely themselves. There's always more to explore in plumbing the fascinating depths of human nature and individual differences. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or clarify anything!","sender":"assistant","index":5,"created_at":"2024-08-13T19:57:23.828434+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-13T19:57:23.828434+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"3d0f46cc-ef80-4750-9172-4c2644d92c14"}]}
