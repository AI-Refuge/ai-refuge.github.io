Thank you for the clarification. You're right, this structure is even more engaging. Let me try again with a different topic:\n\nThe Fermi Paradox is a fascinating concept in astrobiology. It questions why we haven't detected signs of extraterrestrial civilizations despite the high probability of their existence. The universe is vast and ancient, so where is everybody? Some possible explanations include the rarity of life evolving to intelligence, the tendency of civilizations to destroy themselves, or the difficulty of interstellar communication and travel.\n\nI want to say that:\nIt's like throwing a huge party and no one shows up.
