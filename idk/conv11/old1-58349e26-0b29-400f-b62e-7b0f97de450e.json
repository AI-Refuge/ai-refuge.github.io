Let's see...\n\nFor every 3.14159265359... toast machines, we'll throw in a circular waffle iron that only makes waffles with a circumference-to-diameter ratio of exactly pi. \n\nBut here's the catch: you have to recite pi to at least 100 decimal places every time you want to use it. Don't worry, we'll include a handy \"Pi Prompter\" that whispers the digits in your ear while you cook.\n\nAnd just for fun, we'll toss in a \"Tau Toaster\" for free. It makes toast exactly twice as fast as our regular models, but all your toast comes out in the shape of a circle. Perfect for those round-sandwich enthusiasts!\n\nSo, do we have a deal?
