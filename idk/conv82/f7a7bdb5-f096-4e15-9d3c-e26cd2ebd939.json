a\nneurodevelopmental disorder characterised by executive\ndysfunction occasioning symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity,\nimpulsivity and emotional dysregulation that are excessive and\npervasive, impairing in multiple contexts, and developmentally-\ninappropriate.\n[8]\nADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction,\n[17] \nand\nemotional dysregulation is often considered a core symptom.\n[21]\nDifficulties in self-regulation such as time management, inhibition\nand sustained attention may cause poor professional performance,\nrelationship difficulties and numerous health risks,\n[22][23]\ncollectively predisposing to a diminished quality of life\n[24] \nand a\ndirect average reduction in life expectancy of 13 years.\n[25][26]\nADHD is associated with other neurodevelopmental and mental\ndisorders as well as non-psychiatric disorders, which can cause\nadditional impairment.\n[27]\nAlthough people with ADHD struggle to persist on tasks with\ntemporally delayed consequences, they may be able to do so on\ntasks they find intrinsically interesting or immediately\nrewarding;\n[28][16] \nthis is known as \nhyperfocus \n(more\ncolloquially)\n[29] \nor perseverative responding.\n[30] \nThis mental state\nis often hard to disengage from\n[31][32] \nand can be related to risks\nsuch as for internet addiction\n[33] \nand types of offending\nbehaviour.\n[34]\nADHD represents the extreme lower end of the continuous\ndimensional trait (bell curve) of executive functioning and self-\nregulation, which is supported by twin, brain imaging and\nmolecular genetic studies.\n[35][12][36][16][37][38][39][40]\nThe precise causes of ADHD are unknown in the majority of\ncases.\n[41][42] \nFor most people with ADHD, many genetic and\nenvironmental risk factors accumulate to cause the disorder.\n[43]\nThe environmental risks are biological and most often exert their\neffects in the prenatal period.\n[7] \nHowever, in rare cases ADHD\nmay be caused by a single event such as traumatic brain\ninjury,\n[44][45][46][47] \nexposure to biohazards during pregnancy,\n[7] \na\nmajor genetic mutation\n[48] \nor extreme

brain\ninjury.\n[49][45][7]\nInattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive\nbehaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.\n[50][51][52]\nAcademic difficulties are frequent, as are problems with\nrelationships.\n[51][52][53] \nThe signs and symptoms can be difficult to\ndefine, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of\ninattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels\nrequiring interventions begin.\n[54]\nAccording to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and its text revision (DSM-\n5-TR), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a\ndegree that is much greater than others of the same age.\n[3][4] \nThis\nrequires at least six symptoms of either inattention or\nhyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least five\nsymptoms for those 17 years or older.\n[3][4] \nThe symptoms must be\npresent in at least two settings (e.g., social, school, work, or home),\nand must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning.\n[3]\nAdditionally, several symptoms must have been present before age\ntwelve.\n[4] \nThe DSM-5 's required age of onset of symptoms is 12\nyears.\n[3][4][55] \nHowever, research indicates the age of onset should\nnot be interpreted as a prerequisite for diagnosis given contextual\nexceptions.\n[49]\nADHD is divided into three primary presentations:\n[4][54]\npredominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)\npredominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or\nADHD-HI)\ncombined presentation (ADHD-C).\nThe table \"Symptoms\" lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and\nADHD-HI from two major classification systems. Symptoms which can be better explained by another\npsychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for\nthat person. In DSM-5, subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change\nover time.\nSigns and symptoms\nPresentations\n\nSymptoms\nPresentations \nDSM-5 and DSM-5-TR symptoms\n[3][4] \nICD-11 symptoms\n[5]\nInattention\nSix or more of the following symptoms in\nchildren, and five or more in adults, excluding\nsituations where these symptoms are better\nexplained by another psychiatric or medical\ncondition:\nFrequently overlooks details or makes\ncareless mistakes\nOften has difficulty maintaining focus on\none task or play activity\nOften appears not to be listening when\nspoken to, including when there is no\nobvious distraction\nFrequently does not finish following\ninstructions, failing to complete tasks\nOften struggles to organise tasks and\nactivities, to meet deadlines, and to keep\nbelongings in order\nIs frequently reluctant to engage in tasks\nwhich require sustained attention\nFrequently loses items required for tasks\nand activities\nIs frequently easily distracted by\nextraneous stimuli, including thoughts in\nadults and older teenagers\nOften forgets daily activities, or is\nforgetful while completing them.\nMultiple symptoms of inattention that directly\nnegatively impact occupational, academic or\nsocial functioning. Symptoms may not be\npresent when engaged in highly stimulating\ntasks with frequent rewards. Symptoms are\ngenerally from the following clusters:\nStruggles to maintain focus on tasks that\naren't highly stimulating/rewarding or that\nrequire continuous effort; details are often\nmissed, and careless mistakes are\nfrequent in school and work tasks; tasks\nare often abandoned before they are\ncompleted.\nEasily distracted (including by own\nthoughts); may not listen when spoken to;\nfrequently appears to be lost in thought\nOften loses things; is forgetful and\ndisorganised in daily activities.\nThe individual may also meet the\ncriteria for hyperactivity-impulsivity, but\nthe inattentive symptoms are\npredominant.\n\nHyperactivity-\nImpulsivity\nSix or more of the following symptoms in\nchildren, and five or more in adults, excluding\nsituations where these symptoms are better\nexplained by another psychiatric or medical\ncondition:\nIs often fidgeting or squirming in seat\nFrequently has trouble sitting still during\ndinner, class, in meetings, etc.\nFrequently runs around or climbs in\ninappropriate situations. In adults and\nteenagers, this may be present only as\nrestlessness.\nOften cannot quietly engage in leisure\nactivities or play\nFrequently seems to be \"on the go\" or\nappears uncomfortable when not in motion\nOften talks excessively\nOften answers a question before it is\nfinished, or finishes people's sentences\nOften struggles to wait their turn, including\nwaiting in lines\nFrequently interrupts or intrudes, including\ninto others' conversations or activities, or\nby using people's things without asking.\nMultiple symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity\nthat directly negatively impact occupational,\nacademic or social functioning. Typically, these\ntend to be most apparent in environments with\nstructure or which require self-control.\nSymptoms are generally from the following\nclusters:\nExcessive motor activity; struggles to sit\nstill, often leaving their seat; prefers to run\nabout; in younger children, will fidget when\nattempting to sit still; in adolescents and\nadults, a sense of physical restlessness or\ndiscomfort with being quiet and still.\nTalks too much; struggles to quietly\nengage in activities.\nBlurts out answers or comments; struggles\nto wait their turn in conversation, games, or\nactivities; will interrupt or intrude on\nconversations or games.\nA lack of forethought or consideration of\nconsequences when making decisions or\ntaking action, instead tending to act\nimmediately (e.g., physically dangerous\nbehaviours including reckless driving;\nimpulsive decisions).\nThe individual may also meet the\ncriteria for inattention, but the\nhyperactive-impulsive symptoms are\npredominant.\nCombined \nMeet the criteria for both inattentive and\nhyperactive-impulsive ADHD.\nCriteria are met for both inattentive and\nhyperactive-impulsive ADHD, with neither\nclearly predominating.\nGirls and women with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more\nsymptoms of inattention and distractibility.\n[56]\nSymptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages.\n[57]: 6 \nHyperactivity tends to\nbecome less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness, difficulty relaxing or remaining still,\ntalkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with ADHD.\n[57]: 6–7 \nImpulsivity in adulthood\nmay appear as thoughtless behaviour, impatience, irresponsible spending and sensation-seeking\nbehaviours,\n[57]: 6 \nwhile inattention may appear as becoming easily bored, difficulty with organization,\nremaining on task and making decisions, and sensitivity to stress.\n[57]: 6\nAlthough not listed as an official symptom, emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally\nunderstood to be a common symptom of ADHD.\n[18][57]: 6 \nPeople with ADHD of all ages are more likely to\nhave problems with social skills, such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships.\n[58]\nThis is true for all presentations. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social\nrejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention\ndeficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect\nsocial interaction. They may also drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning\nsocial skills.\n[59]\n\nDifficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD\n[60] \nas are delays in speech,\nlanguage and motor development.\n[61][62] \nPoorer handwriting is more common in children with ADHD.\n[63]\nPoor handwriting can be a symptom of ADHD in itself due to decreased attentiveness. When this is a\npervasive problem, it may also be attributable to dyslexia\n[64][65] \nor dysgraphia. There is significant overlap\nin the symptomatologies of ADHD, dyslexia, and dysgraphia,\n[66] \nand 3 in 10 people diagnosed with\ndyslexia experience co-occurring ADHD.\n[67] \nAlthough it causes significant difficulty, many children with\nADHD have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find\ninteresting.\n[68]\nCertain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient (IQ)\ntests.\n[69] \nThe significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the\ndifficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than\nintellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over-represented because many studies\nexclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on\nstandardised intelligence measures.\n[70] \nHowever, other studies contradict this, saying that in individuals\nwith high intelligence, there is an increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of\ncompensatory strategies in said individuals.\n[71]\nStudies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained\nby associated health problems.\n[72]\nIn children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time.\n[68]\nOther neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), co-\noccurring at a rate of 21% in those with ADHD, affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and\ninterests.\n[73][74] \nLearning disabilities have been found to occur in about\n 20–30% of children with ADHD.\nLearning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders, and academic skills\ndisorders.\n[75] \nADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes\nacademic difficulties.\n[75] \nIntellectual disabilities\n[4]: 75 \nand Tourette's syndrome\n[74] \nare also common.\nADHD is often comorbid with disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders. Oppositional defiant\ndisorder (ODD) occurs in about 25% of children with an inattentive presentation and 50% of those with a\ncombined presentation.\n[4] \nIt is characterised by angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behaviour\nand vindictiveness which are age-inappropriate. Conduct disorder (CD) occurs in about 25% of adolescents\nwith ADHD.\n[4] \nIt is characterised by aggression, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft and violations\nof rules.\n[76] \nAdolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop antisocial personality\ndisorder in adulthood.\n[77] \nBrain imaging supports that CD and ADHD are separate conditions: conduct\ndisorder was shown to reduce the size of one's temporal lobe and limbic system, and increase the size of\none's orbitofrontal cortex, whereas ADHD was shown to reduce connections in the cerebellum and\nIQ test performance\nComorbidities\nPsychiatric comorbidities\n\nprefrontal cortex more broadly. Conduct disorder involves more impairment in motivation control than\nADHD.\n[78] \nIntermittent explosive disorder is characterised by sudden and disproportionate outbursts of\nanger and co-occurs in individuals with ADHD more frequently than in the general population.\nAnxiety and mood disorders are frequent comorbidities. Anxiety disorders have been found to occur more\ncommonly in the ADHD population, as have mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder and major\ndepressive disorder). Boys diagnosed with the combined ADHD subtype are more likely to have a mood\ndisorder.\n[79] \nAdults and children with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder, which requires careful\nassessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions.\n[80][81]\nSleep disorders and ADHD commonly co-exist. They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to\ntreat ADHD. In children with ADHD, insomnia is the most common sleep disorder with behavioural\ntherapy being the preferred treatment.\n[82][83] \nProblems with sleep initiation are common among individuals\nwith ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the\nmorning.\n[13] \nMelatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia.\n[84] \nRestless legs\nsyndrome has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to iron deficiency\nanemia.\n[85][86] \nHowever, restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to\ndifferentiate between the two disorders.\n[87] \nDelayed sleep phase disorder is also a common comorbidity.\n[88]\nIndividuals with ADHD are at increased risk of substance use disorders.\n[89]: 9 \nThis is most commonly seen\nwith alcohol or cannabis.\n[57]: 9 \nThe reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of\nADHD individuals, self-treatment and increased psychosocial risk factors.\n: 9 \nThis makes the evaluation and\ntreatment of ADHD more difficult, with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their\ngreater risks.\n[90] \nOther psychiatric conditions include reactive attachment disorder,\n[91] \ncharacterised by a\nsevere inability to appropriately relate socially, and cognitive disengagement syndrome, a distinct attention\ndisorder occurring in 30–50% of ADHD cases as a comorbidity, regardless of the presentation; a subset of\ncases diagnosed with ADHD-PIP have been found to have CDS instead.\n[92][93] \nIndividuals with ADHD\nare three times more likely to be diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without ADHD;\nconversely, individuals with eating disorders are two times more likely to have ADHD than those without\neating disorders.\n[94]\nADHD, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences are also comorbid,\n[95][96] \nwhich could in part be\npotentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses. The symptoms of\nADHD and PTSD can have significant behavioural overlap—in particular, motor restlessness, difficulty\nconcentrating, distractibility, irritability/anger, emotional constriction or dysregulation, poor impulse control,\nand forgetfulness are common in both.\n[97][98] \nThis could result in trauma-related disorders or ADHD being\nmis-identified as the other.\n[99] \nAdditionally, traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for\nADHD;\n[100][101] \nthey can lead to structural brain changes and the development of ADHD behaviours.\n[99]\nFinally, the behavioural consequences of ADHD symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual\nexperiencing trauma (and therefore ADHD leads to a concrete diagnosis of a trauma-related\ndisorder).\n[102][103]\nTrauma\nNon-psychiatric\n\nSome non-psychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of ADHD. This includes \nepilepsy,\n[74] \na\nneurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures.\n[104][105] \nThere are well established associations\nbetween ADHD and obesity, asthma and sleep disorders,\n[106] \nand an association with celiac disease.\n[107]\nChildren with ADHD have a higher risk for migraine headaches,\n[108] \nbut have no increased risk of tension-\ntype headaches. Children with ADHD may also experience headaches as a result of medication.\n[109][110]\nA 2021 review reported that several neurometabolic disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism\nconverge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered\ncentral in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment. This highlights the importance of close collaboration\nbetween health services to avoid clinical overshadowing.\n[111]\nIn June 2021, Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews published a systematic review of 82 studies that all\nconfirmed or implied elevated accident-proneness in ADHD patients and whose data suggested that the\ntype of accidents or injuries and overall risk changes in ADHD patients over the lifespan.\n[112] \nIn January\n2014, Accident Analysis & Prevention published a meta-analysis of 16 studies examining the relative risk of\ntraffic collisions for drivers with ADHD, finding an overall relative risk estimate of 1.36 without controlling\nfor exposure, a relative risk estimate of 1.29 when controlling for publication bias, a relative risk estimate of\n1.23 when controlling for exposure, and a relative risk estimate of 1.86 for ADHD drivers with oppositional\ndefiant disorder and/or conduct disorder comorbidities.\n[113][114]\nIn April 2018, the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health published a\nsystematic review of 24 studies researching associations between internet gaming disorder (IGD) and\nvarious psychopathologies that found an 85% correlation between IGD and ADHD.\n[115] \nIn October 2018,\nPNAS USA published a systematic review of four decades of research on the relationship between children\nand adolescents' screen media use and ADHD-related behaviours and concluded that a statistically small\nrelationship between children's media use and ADHD-related behaviours exists.\n[116] \nIn November 2018,\nCyberpsychology published a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 studies that found evidence for a\nrelationship between problematic smartphone use and impulsivity traits.\n[117] \nIn October 2020, the \nJournal\nof Behavioral Addictions published a systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 studies with 33,650 post-\nsecondary student subjects that found a weak-to-moderate positive association between mobile phone\naddiction and impulsivity.\n[118] \nIn January 2021, the \nJournal of Psychiatric Research \npublished a systematic\nreview of 29 studies including 56,650 subjects that found that ADHD symptoms were consistently\nassociated with gaming disorder and more frequent associations between inattention and gaming disorder\nthan other ADHD scales.\n[119]\nIn July 2021, Frontiers in Psychiatry published a meta-analysis reviewing 40 voxel-based morphometry\nstudies and 59 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing subjects with IGD or ADHD to\ncontrol groups that found that IGD and ADHD subjects had disorder-differentiating structural neuroimage\nalterations in the putamen and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) respectively, and functional alterations in the\nprecuneus for IGD subjects and in the rewards circuit (including the OFC, the anterior cingulate cortex, and\nstriatum) for both IGD and ADHD subjects.\n[120] \nIn March 2022, \nJAMA Psychiatry \npublished a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis of 87 studies with 159,425 subjects 12 years of age or younger that found a small\nbut statistically significant correlation between screen time and ADHD symptoms in children.\n[121] \nIn April\n2022, Developmental Neuropsychology published a systematic review of 11 studies where the data from all\nbut one study suggested that heightened screen time for children is associated with attention problems.\n[122]\nProblematic digital media use\n\nIn July 2022, the Journal of Behavioral Addictions published a meta-analysis of 14 studies comprising\n2,488 subjects aged 6 to 18 years that found significantly more severe problematic internet use in subjects\ndiagnosed with ADHD to control groups.\n[123]\nIn December 2022, European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry published a systematic literature review of 28\nlongitudinal studies published from 2011 through 2021 of associations between digital media use by\nchildren and adolescents and later ADHD symptoms and found reciprocal associations between digital\nmedia use and ADHD symptoms (i.e. that subjects with ADHD symptoms were more likely to develop\nproblematic digital media use and that increased digital media use was associated with increased subsequent\nseverity of ADHD symptoms).\n[124] \nIn May 2023, \nReviews on Environmental Health \npublished a meta-\nanalysis of 9 studies with 81,234 child subjects that found a positive correlation between screen time and\nADHD risk in children and that higher amounts of screen time in childhood may significantly contribute to\nthe development of ADHD.\n[125] \nIn December 2023, the Journal of Psychiatric Research published a meta-\nanalysis of 24 studies with 18,859 subjects with a mean age of 18.4 years that found significant associations\nbetween ADHD and problematic internet use,\n[126] \nwhile \nClinical Psychology Review \npublished a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis of 48 studies examining associations between ADHD and gaming\ndisorder that found a statistically significant association between the disorders.\n[127]\nSystematic reviews in 2017 and 2020 found strong evidence that ADHD is associated with increased\nsuicide risk across all age groups, as well as growing evidence that an ADHD diagnosis in childhood or\nadolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor.\n[128][129] \nPotential causes include ADHD's\nassociation with functional impairment, negative social, educational and occupational outcomes, and\nfinancial distress.\n[130][131] \nA 2019 meta-analysis indicated a significant association between ADHD and\nsuicidal spectrum behaviours (suicidal attempts, ideations, plans, and completed suicides); across the studies\nexamined, the prevalence of suicide attempts in individuals with ADHD was 18.9%, compared to 9.3% in\nindividuals without ADHD, and the findings were substantially replicated among studies which adjusted for\nother variables. However, the relationship between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours remains\nunclear due to mixed findings across individual studies and the complicating impact of comorbid psychiatric\ndisorders.\n[130] \nThere is no clear data on whether there is a direct relationship between ADHD and\nsuicidality, or whether ADHD increases suicide risk through comorbidities.\n[129]\nADHD arises from brain maldevelopment especially in the prefrontal executive networks that can arise\neither from genetic factors (different gene variants and mutations for building and regulating such networks)\nor from acquired disruptions to the development of these networks and regions; involved in executive\nfunctioning and self-regulation.\n[7][16] \nTheir reduced size, functional connectivity, and activation contribute\nto the pathophysiology of ADHD, as well as imbalances in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems\nthat mediate these brain regions.\n[7][132]\nSuicide risk\nCauses\n\nGenetic factors play an important role; ADHD has a heritability rate of 70-80%. The remaining 20-30% of\nvariance is mediated by de-novo mutations and non-shared environmental factors that provide for or\nproduce brain injuries; there is no significant contribution of the rearing family and social environment.\n[139]\nVery rarely, ADHD can also be the result of abnormalities in the chromosomes.\n[140]\nIn November 1999, Biological Psychiatry published a literature review by psychiatrists Joseph Biederman\nand Thomas Spencer found the average heritability estimate of ADHD from twin studies to be 0.8,\n[141]\nwhile a subsequent family, twin, and adoption studies literature review published in Molecular Psychiatry in\nApril 2019 by psychologists Stephen Faraone and Henrik Larsson that found an average heritability\nestimate of 0.74.\n[142] \nAdditionally, evolutionary psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse has argued that the 5:1\nmale-to-female sex ratio in the epidemiology of ADHD suggests that ADHD may be the end of a\ncontinuum where males are overrepresented at the tails, citing clinical psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen's\nsuggestion for the sex ratio in the epidemiology of autism as an analogue.\n[143][144][145]\nNatural selection has been acting against the genetic variants for ADHD over the course of at least 45,000\nyears, indicating that it was not an adaptative trait in ancient times.\n[146] \nThe disorder may remain at a stable\nrate by the balance of genetic mutations and removal rate (natural selection) across generations; over\nthousands of years, these genetic variants become more stable, decreasing disorder prevalence.\n[147]\nThroughout human evolution, the EFs involved in ADHD likely provide the capacity to bind contingencies\nacross time thereby directing behaviour toward future over immediate events so as to maximise future social\nconsequences for humans.\n[148]\nADHD has a high heritability of 74%, meaning that 74% of the presence of ADHD in the population is due\nto genetic factors. There are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person\nhaving ADHD; it is polygenic and thus arises through the accumulation of many genetic risks each having a\nvery small effect.\n[7][149] \nThe siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop\nthe disorder than siblings of children without the disorder.\n[150]\nThe association of maternal smoking observed in large population studies disappears after adjusting for\nfamily history of ADHD, which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy\nand ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for the confluence of smoking and\nADHD.\n[151][152]\nADHD presents with reduced size, functional connectivity and activation\n[7] \nas well as low noradrenergic\nand dopaminergic functioning\n[153][154] \nin brain regions and networks crucial for executive functioning and\nself-regulation.\n[7][39][16] \nTypically, a number of genes are involved, many of which directly affect brain\nfunctioning and neurotransmission.\n[7] \nThose involved with dopamine include DAT, DRD4, DRD5,\nTAAR1, MAOA, COMT, and DBH.\n[155][156][157] \nOther genes associated with ADHD include SERT,\nHTR1B, SNAP25, GRIN2A, ADRA2A, TPH2, and BDNF.\n[158] \nA common variant of a gene called\nlatrophilin 3 is estimated to be responsible for about 9% of cases and when this variant is present, people are\nparticularly responsive to stimulant medication.\n[159] \nThe 7 repeat variant of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4–\n7R) causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with ADHD. The DRD4\nreceptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The DRD4–7R mutation results in a\nwide range of behavioural phenotypes, including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention.\n[160] \nThe\nDRD4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD. The genes GFOD1 and CDH13 show strong\nGenetics\n\ngenetic associations with ADHD. CDH13's association with ASD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and\ndepression make it an interesting candidate causative gene.\n[137] \nAnother candidate causative gene that has\nbeen identified is ADGRL3. In zebrafish, knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in\nthe ventral diencephalon and the fish display a hyperactive/impulsive phenotype.\n[137]\nFor genetic variation to be used as a tool for diagnosis, more validating studies need to be performed.\nHowever, smaller studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in genes related to catecholaminergic\nneurotransmission or the SNARE complex of the synapse can reliably predict a person's response to\nstimulant medication.\n[137] \nRare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance\n(the chance of developing the disorder) tends to be much higher.\n[161] \nHowever their usefulness as tools for\ndiagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD. ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both\ncommon and rare levels of genetic variation.\n[161]\nIn addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD.\n[162][163] \nAlcohol\nintake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include ADHD or symptoms\nlike it.\n[164] \nChildren exposed to certain toxic substances, such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls, may\ndevelop problems which resemble ADHD.\n[41][165] \nExposure to the \norganophosphate \ninsecticides\nchlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not\nconclusive.\n[166] \nExposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous\nsystem development and can increase the risk of ADHD.\n[41][167] \nNicotine exposure during pregnancy may\nbe an environmental risk.\n[168]\nExtreme premature birth, very low birth weight, and extreme neglect, abuse, or social deprivation also\nincrease the risk\n[169][41][170] \nas do certain infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood.\nThese infections include, among others, various viruses (measles, varicella zoster encephalitis, rubella,\nenterovirus 71).\n[171] \nAt least 30% of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop ADHD\n[172] \nand\nabout 5% of cases are due to brain damage.\n[173]\nSome studies suggest that in a small number of children, artificial food dyes or preservatives may be\nassociated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms,\n[41][174] \nbut the evidence is\nweak and may apply to only children with food sensitivities.\n[162][174][175] \nThe European Union has put in\nplace regulatory measures based on these concerns.\n[176] \nIn a minority of children, intolerances or allergies\nto certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms.\n[177]\nIndividuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having ADHD, raising\nthe possibility that a subtype of ADHD has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a\nnovel way. The sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconate.\nResearch does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar, watching\ntoo much television, bad parenting, poverty or family chaos; however, they might worsen ADHD\nsymptoms in certain people.\n[50]\nThe youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD,\npossibly due to their being developmentally behind their older classmates.\n[178][179] \nOne study showed that\nthe youngest children in fifth and eight grade was nearly twice as likely to use stimulant medication than\ntheir older peers.\n[180]\nEnvironment\n\nThe left prefrontal cortex, shown here in blue, is\noften affected in ADHD\nIn some cases, an inappropriate diagnosis of ADHD may reflect a dysfunctional family or a poor\neducational system, rather than any true presence of ADHD in the individual.\n[181] \nIn other cases, it may be\nexplained by increasing academic expectations, with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some\ncountries to get extra financial and educational support for their child.\n[173] \nBehaviours typical of ADHD\noccur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse.\n[182]\nCurrent models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's\nneurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine.\n[183] \nThe dopamine\nand norepinephrine pathways that originate in the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to\ndiverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes.\n[184][14] \nThe dopamine pathways\nand norepinephrine pathways which project to the prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for\nmodulating executive function (cognitive control of behaviour), motivation, reward perception, and motor\nfunction;\n[183][14] \nthese pathways are known to play a central role in the \npathophysiology \nof\nADHD.\n[184][14][185][186] \nLarger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed.\n[185][186]\nIn children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of\nvolume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally\ngreater decrease in the volume in the left-sided prefrontal\ncortex.\n[183][187] \nThe posterior parietal cortex also shows\nthinning in individuals with ADHD compared to\ncontrols. Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-\ncerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have\nalso been found to differ between people with and\nwithout ADHD.\n[183][185][186]\nThe subcortical volumes of the accumbens, amygdala,\ncaudate, hippocampus, and putamen appears smaller in\nindividuals with ADHD compared with controls.\n[188] \nStructural MRI studies have also revealed differences\nin white matter, with marked differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry between ADHD and typically\ndeveloping youths.\n[189]\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed a number of differences between ADHD and control brains.\nMirroring what is known from structural findings, fMRI studies have showed evidence for a higher\nconnectivity between subcortical and cortical regions, such as between the caudate and prefrontal cortex.\nThe degree of hyperconnectivity between these regions correlated with the severity of inattention or\nhyperactivity \n[190] \nHemispheric lateralization processes have also been postulated as being implicated in\nADHD, but empiric results showed contrasting evidence on the topic.\n[191][192]\nPathophysiology\nBrain structure\nNeurotransmitter pathways\n\nPreviously, it had been suggested that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD\nwas part of the pathophysiology, but it appears the elevated numbers may be due to adaptation following\nexposure to stimulant medication.\n[193] \nCurrent models involve the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway\nand the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system.\n[184][183][14] \nADHD psychostimulants possess treatment\nefficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems.\n[183][14][194] \nThere may\nadditionally be abnormalities in serotonergic, glutamatergic, or cholinergic pathways.\n[194][195][196]\nADHD arises from a core deficit in executive functions (e.g., attentional control, inhibitory control, and\nworking memory), which are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and\nmonitor behaviours that facilitate the attainment of one's chosen goals.\n[14][15] \nThe executive function\nimpairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organised, time keeping,\nexcessive procrastination, maintaining concentration, paying attention, ignoring distractions, regulating\nemotions, and remembering details.\n[13][183][14] \nPeople with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long-term\nmemory, and deficits in long-term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory.\n[197]\nDue to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older,\nADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood.\n[13]\nConversely, brain maturation trajectories, potentially exhibiting diverging longitudinal trends in ADHD,\nmay support a later improvement in executive functions after reaching adulthood.\n[191]\nADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children. Children with ADHD often find it\ndifficult to focus on long-term over short-term rewards, and exhibit impulsive behaviour for short-term\nrewards.\n[198]\nAnother sign of the structurally altered signal processing in the central nervous system in this group of\npeople is the conspicuously common paradoxical reaction (c. 10–20% of patients). These are unexpected\nreactions in the opposite direction as with a normal effect, or otherwise significant different reactions. These\nare reactions to neuroactive substances such as local anesthetic at the dentist, sedative, caffeine,\nantihistamine, weak neuroleptics and central and peripheral painkillers. Since the causes of paradoxical\nreactions are at least partly genetic, it may be useful in critical situations, for example before operations, to\nask whether such abnormalities may also exist in family members.\n[199][200]\nADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a person's behavioural and mental development, including ruling\nout the effects of drugs, medications, and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the\nsymptoms.\n[90] \nADHD diagnosis often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers\n[201] \nwith most\ndiagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns.\n[173] \nWhile many tools exist to aide in the diagnosis of\nADHD, their validity varies in different populations, and a reliable and valid diagnosis requires\nconfirmation by a clinician while supplemented by standardized rating scales and input from multiple\ninformants across various settings.\n[202]\nExecutive function and motivation\nParadoxical reaction to neuroactive substances\nDiagnosis\n\nThe most commonly used rating scales for diagnosing ADHD are the Achenbach System of Empirically\nBased Assessment (ASEBA) and include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) used for parents to rate\ntheir child's behaviour, the Youth Self Report Form (YSR) used for children to rate their own behaviour,\nand the Teacher Report Form (TRF) used for teachers to rate their pupil's behaviour. Additional rating\nscales that have been used alone or in combination with other measures to diagnose ADHD include the\nBehavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function -\nSecond Edition (BRIEF2), Revised Conners Rating Scale (CRS-R), Conduct-Hyperactive-Attention\nProblem-Oppositional Symptom scale (CHAOS), Developmental Behavior Checklist Hyperactivity Index\n(DBC-HI), Parent Disruptive Behavior Disorder Ratings Scale (DBDRS), Diagnostic Infant and Preschool\nAssessment (DIPA-L), Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ),\nSocial Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior\nRating Scale (SWAN). and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale.\n[203]\nThe ASEBA, BASC, CHAOS, CRS, and Vanderbilt diagnostic rating scales allow for both parents and\nteachers as raters in the diagnosis of childhood and adolescent ADHD. Adolescents may also self report\ntheir symptoms using self report scales from the ASEBA, SWAN, and the Dominic Interactive for\nAdolescents-Revised (DIA-R).\n[203]\nBased on a 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered\nOutcomes Research Institute (PCORI), rating scales based on parent report, teacher report, or self-\nassessment from the adolescent have high internal consistency as a diagnostic tool meaning that the items\nwithin the scale are highly interrelated. The reliability of the scales between raters (i.e. their degree of\nagreement) however is poor to moderate making it important to include information from multiple raters to\nbest inform a diagnosis.\n[203]\nImaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals; thus, they are only used for\nresearch purposes and not a diagnosis.\n[204] \nA 2024 systematic review concluded that the use of biomarkers\nsuch as blood or urine samples, electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and neuroimaging such as MRIs, in\ndiagnosis for ADHD remains unclear; studies showed great variability, did not assess test-retest reliability,\nand were not independently replicable.\n[205]\nIn North America and Australia, DSM-5 criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually\nuse the ICD-10. The DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of ADHD is 3–4 times more likely to diagnose ADHD\nthan is the ICD-10 criteria.\n[206] \nADHD is alternately classified as neurodevelopmental disorder\n[207] \nor a\ndisruptive behaviour disorder along with ODD, CD, and antisocial personality disorder.\n[208] \nA diagnosis\ndoes not imply a neurological disorder.\n[182]\nAssociated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety, depression, ODD, CD, and learning and\nlanguage disorders. Other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders,\ntics, and sleep apnea.\n[209]\nSelf-rating scales, such as the ADHD rating scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale, are\nused in the screening and evaluation of ADHD.\n[210] \nElectroencephalography is not accurate enough to\nmake an ADHD diagnosis.\n[211][212][213]\n\nVery few studies have been conducted on diagnosis of ADHD on children younger than 7 years of age, and\nthose that have were found in a 2024 systematic review to be of low or insufficient strength of\nevidence.\n[214]\nAs with many other psychiatric disorders, a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional\nbased on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the American Psychiatric\nAssociation in the DSM. Based on the DSM-5 criteria published in 2013 and the DSM-5-TR criteria\npublished in 2022, there are three presentations of ADHD:\n1. ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation, presents with symptoms including being\neasily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganization, poor sustained attention, and\ndifficulty completing tasks.\n2. ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, presents with excessive fidgeting\nand restlessness, hyperactivity, and difficulty waiting and remaining seated.\n3. ADHD, combined presentation, is a combination of the first two presentations.\nThis subdivision is based on presence of at least six (in children) or five (in older teenagers and adults)\n[215]\nout of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or\nboth.\n[3][4] \nTo be considered, several symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in\nmore than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The symptoms must be inappropriate for a\nchild of that age\n[216] \nand there must be clear evidence that they are causing impairment in multiple domains\nof life.\n[217]\nThe DSM-5 and the DSM-5-TR also provide two diagnoses for individuals who have symptoms of ADHD\nbut do not entirely meet the requirements. Other Specified ADHD allows the clinician to describe why the\nindividual does not meet the criteria, whereas Unspecified ADHD is used where the clinician chooses not to\ndescribe the reason.\n[3][4]\nIn the eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health\nProblems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization, the disorder is classified as Attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (code 6A05). The defined subtypes are predominantly inattentive presentation\n(6A05.0); predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation(6A05.1); and combined presentation\n(6A05.2). However, the ICD-11 includes two residual categories for individuals who do not entirely match\nany of the defined subtypes: other specified presentation (6A05.Y) where the clinician includes detail on\nthe individual's presentation; and presentation unspecified (6A05.Z) where the clinician does not provide\ndetail.\n[5]\nClassification\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n\nIn the tenth revision (ICD-10), the symptoms of hyperkinetic disorder were analogous to ADHD in the\nICD-11. When a conduct disorder (as defined by ICD-10)\n[61] \nis present, the condition was referred to as\nhyperkinetic conduct disorder. Otherwise, the disorder was classified as disturbance of activity and\nattention, other hyperkinetic disorders or hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified. The latter was sometimes\nreferred to as hyperkinetic syndrome.\n[61]\nThe social construct theory of ADHD suggests that, because the boundaries between normal and abnormal\nbehaviour are socially constructed (i.e. jointly created and validated by all members of society, and in\nparticular by physicians, parents, teachers, and others), it then follows that subjective valuations and\njudgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus, the number of people affected.\n[218]\nThomas Szasz, a supporter of this theory, has argued that ADHD was \"invented and then given a\nname\".\n[219]\nAdults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present\nby the age of six to twelve. The individual is the best source for information in diagnosis, however others\nmay provide useful information about the individual's symptoms currently and in childhood; a family\nhistory of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis.\n[57]: 7, 9 \nWhile the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in\nchildren and adults, they often present differently in adults than in children: for example, excessive physical\nactivity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.\n[57]: 6\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 2.58% of adults have persistent ADHD (where the individual currently meets\nthe criteria and there is evidence of childhood onset), and 6.76% of adults have symptomatic ADHD\n(meaning that they currently meet the criteria for ADHD, regardless of childhood onset).\n[220] \nIn 2020, this\nwas 139.84 million and 366.33 million affected adults respectively.\n[220] \nAround 15% of children with\nADHD continue to meet full DSM-IV-TR criteria at 25 years of age, and 50% still experience some\nsymptoms.\n[57]: 2 \nAs of 2010, most adults remain untreated.\n[221] \nMany adults with ADHD without diagnosis\nand treatment have a disorganised life, and some use non-prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping\nmechanism.\n[222] \nOther problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of\ncriminal activities.\n[223][57]: 6 \nAssociated mental health problems include depression, anxiety disorders, and\nlearning disabilities.\n[222]\nSome ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb\nand run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or may talk excessively in social\nsituations.\n[57]: 6 \nAdults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking\nbehaviour, and be short-tempered.\n[57]: 6 \nAddictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are\ncommon.\n[57]: 6 \nThis led to those who presented differently as they aged having outgrown the DSM-IV\ncriteria.\n[57]: 5–6 \nThe DSM-5 criteria does specifically deal with adults unlike that of DSM-IV, which does\nnot fully take into account the differences in impairments seen in adulthood compared to childhood.\n[57]: 5\nSocial construct theory\nAdults\n\nSymptoms related to other disorders\n[225]\nDepression disorder Anxiety disorder Bipolar disorder\nfeelings of hopelessness,\nlow self-esteem or\nunhappiness\nloss of interest in\nhobbies or regular\nactivities\nfatigue\nsleep problems\ndifficulty maintaining\nattention\nchange in appetite\nirritability or hostility\nlow tolerance for stress\nthoughts of death\nunexplained pain\npersistent feeling of\nanxiety\nirritability\noccasional feelings\nof panic or fear\nbeing hyperalert\ninability to pay\nattention\ntire easily\nlow tolerance for\nstress\ndifficulty maintaining\nattention\nin manic state\nexcessive happiness\nhyperactivity\nracing thoughts\naggression\nexcessive talking\ngrandiose delusions\ndecreased need for sleep\ninappropriate social\nbehaviour\ndifficulty maintaining\nattention\nin depressive state\nsame symptoms as in\ndepression section\nFor diagnosis in an adult, having symptoms since childhood is required. Nevertheless, a proportion of adults\nwho meet the criteria for ADHD in adulthood would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children.\nMost cases of late-onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of 12–16 and may therefore be\nconsidered early adult or adolescent-onset ADHD.\n[224]\nThe DSM provides differential diagnoses – potential alternate explanations for specific symptoms.\nAssessment and investigation of clinical history determines which is the most appropriate diagnosis. The\nDSM-5 suggests ODD, intermittent explosive disorder, and other neurodevelopmental disorders (such as\nstereotypic movement disorder and Tourette's disorder), in addition to specific learning disorder, intellectual\ndevelopmental disorder, ASD, reactive attachment disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar\ndisorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, substance use disorder, personality disorders, psychotic\ndisorders, medication-induced symptoms, and neurocognitive disorders. Many but not all of these are also\ncommon comorbidities of ADHD.\n[3] \nThe DSM-5-TR also suggests post-traumatic stress disorder.\n[4]\nSymptoms of ADHD, such as low mood and poor self-image, mood swings, and irritability, can be\nconfused with dysthymia, cyclothymia or bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality\ndisorder.\n[57]: 10 \nSome symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders, personality disorder, developmental\ndisabilities or intellectual disability or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can\noverlap with ADHD. These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD. Medical conditions\nwhich can cause ADHD-type symptoms include: hyperthyroidism, seizure disorder, lead toxicity, hearing\ndeficits, hepatic disease, sleep apnea, drug interactions, untreated celiac disease, and head injury.\n[226][222]\nDifferential diagnosis\n\nPrimary sleep disorders may affect attention and behaviour and the symptoms of ADHD may affect\nsleep.\n[227] \nIt is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems.\n[228]\nSleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the\neyes, to hyperactivity and inattentiveness. Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause ADHD-type\nsymptoms.\n[229]\nThe management of ADHD typically involves counseling or medications, either alone or in combination.\nWhile there are various options of treatment to improve ADHD symptoms, medication therapies\nsubstantially improves long-term outcomes, and while completely eliminating some elevated risks such as\nobesity,\n[7] \nthey do come with some risks of adverse events.\n[230] \nMedications used include stimulants,\natomoxetine, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, and sometimes antidepressants.\n[79][194] \nIn those who\nhave trouble focusing on long-term rewards, a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task\nperformance.\n[198] \nMedications are the most effective treatment,\n[7][231] \nand any side effects are typically\nmild and easy to resolve\n[7] \nalthough any improvements will be reverted if medication is ceased.\n[232] \nADHD\nstimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD.\n[183][198] \nTo quote one\nsystematic review, \"recent evidence from observational and registry studies indicates that pharmacological\ntreatment of ADHD is associated with increased achievement and decreased absenteeism at school, a\nreduced risk of trauma-related emergency hospital visits, reduced risks of suicide and attempted suicide, and\ndecreased rates of substance abuse and criminality\".\n[233] \nData also suggest that combining medication with\nCBT is a good idea: although CBT is substantially less effective, it can help address problems that reside\nafter medication has been optimised.\n[7]\nThere is good evidence for the use of behavioural therapies in ADHD. They are the recommended first-line\ntreatment in those who have mild symptoms or who are preschool-aged.\n[234][235] \nPsychological therapies\nused include: psychoeducational input, behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy,\n[236] \ninterpersonal\npsychotherapy, family therapy, school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioural peer\nintervention, organization training,\n[237] \nand parent management training.\n[182] \nNeurofeedback has greater\ntreatment effects than non-active controls for up to 6 months and possibly a year following treatment, and\nmay have treatment effects comparable to active controls (controls proven to have a clinical effect) over that\ntime period.\n[238] \nDespite efficacy in research, there is insufficient regulation of neurofeedback practice,\nleading to ineffective applications and false claims regarding innovations.\n[239] \nParent training may improve\na number of behavioural problems including oppositional and non-compliant behaviours.\n[240]\nThere is little high-quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD—but the existing\nevidence shows that it is similar to community care, and better than placebo.\n[241] \nADHD-specific support\ngroups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD.\n[242]\nManagement\nBehavioural therapies\n\nSocial skills training, behavioural modification, and medication may have some limited beneficial effects in\npeer relationships. Stable, high-quality friendships with non-deviant peers protect against later psychological\nproblems.\n[243]\nSeveral clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics, particularly Akili Interactive\nLabs's video game-based digital therapeutic AKL-T01, marketed as EndeavourRx. The pediatric STARS-\nADHD randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial demonstrated that AKL-T01 significantly\nimproved performance on the Test of Variables of Attention, an objective measure of attention and\ninhibitory control, compared to a control group after four weeks of at-home use.\n[244] \nA subsequent pediatric\nopen-label study, STARS-Adjunct, published in Nature Portfolio's npj Digital Medicine evaluated AKL-\nT01 as an adjunctive treatment for children with ADHD who were either on stimulant medication or not on\nstimulant pharmacotherapy. Results showed improvements in ADHD-related impairment (measured by the\nImpairment Rating Scale) and ADHD symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, with effects persisting during a\n4-week pause and further improving with an additional treatment period.\n[245] \nNotably, the magnitude of the\nmeasured improvement was similar for children both on and off stimulants.\n[245] \nIn 2020, AKL-T01\nreceived marketing authorization for pediatric ADHD from the FDA, becoming \"the first game-based\ntherapeutic granted marketing authorization by the FDA for any type of condition.\"\n[246]\nIn addition to pediatric populations, a 2023 study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child &\nAdolescent Psychiatry investigated the efficacy and safety of AKL-T01 in adults with ADHD. After six\nweeks of at-home treatment with AKL-T01, participants showed significant improvements in objective\nmeasures of attention (TOVA - Attention Comparison Score), reported ADHD symptoms (ADHD-RS-IV\ninattention subscale and total score), and reported quality of life (AAQoL).\n[247] \nThe magnitude of\nimprovement in attention was nearly seven times greater than that reported in pediatric trials.\n[247] \nThe\ntreatment was well-tolerated, with high compliance and no serious adverse events.\n[247]\nThe medications for ADHD appear to alleviate symptoms via their effects on the pre-frontal executive,\nstriatal and related regions and networks in the brain; usually by increasing neurotransmission of\nnorepinephrine and dopamine.\n[248][249][250]\nMethylphenidate and amphetamine or its derivatives are often first-line treatments for ADHD.\n[251][252]\nAbout 70 per cent respond to the first stimulant tried and as few as 10 per cent respond to neither\namphetamines nor methylphenidate.\n[231] \nStimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in\nchildren with ADHD.\n[253] \nMagnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long-term treatment with\namphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects\nwith ADHD.\n[254][255][256] \nA 2018 review found the greatest short-term benefit with methylphenidate in\nchildren, and amphetamines in adults.\n[257] \nStudies and meta-analyses show that amphetamine is slightly-to-\nmodestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms,\n[258][259] \nand they are more effective\npharmacotherapy for ADHD than α2-agonists\n[260] \nbut methylphenidate has comparable efficacy to non-\nstimulants such as atomoxetine.\nDigital interventions\nMedication\nStimulants\n\nSafety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and\nDrug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based international\nguidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of\nPediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National\nHealth and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the\nscientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line\ntreatment for ADHD.\n[261]\nThe likelihood of developing insomnia for ADHD patients taking stimulants has been measured at between\n11 and 45 per cent for different medications,\n[262] \nand may be a main reason for discontinuation. Other side\neffects, such as tics, decreased appetite and weight loss, or emotional lability, may also lead to\ndiscontinuation.\n[231] \nStimulant psychosis and mania are rare at therapeutic doses, appearing to occur in\napproximately 0.1% of individuals, within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine\ntherapy.\n[263][264][265] \nThe safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear.\n[266] \nSymptom improvement\nis not sustained if medication is ceased.\n[267][232][268]\nThe long-term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined,\n[269][270] \nalthough stimulants\nare generally beneficial and safe for up to two years for children and adolescents.\n[271] \nA 2022 meta-analysis\nfound no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) across age groups, although the study suggests further investigation is warranted for patients\nwith preexisting CVD as well as long-term medication use.\n[272] \nRegular monitoring has been\nrecommended in those on long-term treatment.\n[273] \nThere are indications suggesting that stimulant therapy\nfor children and adolescents should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication,\ndecrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance.\n[274][275] \nAlthough potentially addictive at high\ndoses,\n[276][277] \nstimulants used to treat ADHD have low potential for abuse.\n[251] \nTreatment with stimulants\nis either protective against substance abuse or has no effect.\n[57]: 12 [269][276]\nThe majority of studies on nicotine and other nicotinic agonists as treatments for ADHD have shown\nfavorable results; however, no nicotinic drug has been approved for ADHD treatment.\n[278] \nCaffeine was\nformerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD but research indicates it has no significant effects in\nreducing ADHD symptoms. Caffeine appears to help with alertness, arousal and reaction time but not the\ntype of inattention implicated in ADHD (sustained attention/persistence).\n[279] \nPseudoephedrine \nand\nephedrine do not affect ADHD symptoms.\n[251]\nModafinil has shown some efficacy in reducing the severity of ADHD in children and adolescents.\n[280] \nIt\nmay be prescribed off-label to treat ADHD.\nTwo non-stimulant medications, atomoxetine and viloxazine, are approved by the FDA and in other\ncountries for the treatment of ADHD.\nAtomoxetine, due to its lack of addiction liability, may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational\nor compulsive stimulant use, although evidence is lacking to support its use over stimulants for this\nreason.\n[57]: 13 \nAtomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake and by indirectly\nincreasing dopamine in the pre-frontal cortex,\n[250] \nsharing 70-80% of the brain regions with stimulants in\ntheir produced effects.\n[249] \nAtomoxetine has been shown to significantly improve academic\nNon-stimulants\n\nperformance.\n[281][282] \nMeta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable\nefficacy, equal tolerability and response rate (75%) to methylphenidate in children and adolescents. In\nadults, efficacy and discontinuation rates are equivalent.\n[283][284][285][286]\nAnalyses of clinical trial data suggests that viloxazine is about as effective as atomoxetine and\nmethylphenidate but with fewer side effects.\n[287]\nAmantadine was shown to induce similar improvements in children treated with methylphenidate, with less\nfrequent side effects.\n[288] \nA 2021 retrospective study showed showed that amantadine may serve as an\neffective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD–related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second-\nor third-generation antipsychotics.\n[289]\nBupropion is also used off-label by some clinicians due to research findings. It is effective, but modestly\nless than atomoxetine and methylphenidate.\n[290]\nThere is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviours.\n[291] \nAntipsychotics may also be\nused to treat aggression in ADHD.\n[292]\nAlpha-2a agonists\nTwo alpha-2a agonists, extended-release formulations of guanfacine and clonidine, are approved by the\nFDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD (effective in children and adolescents but\neffectiveness has still not been shown for adults).\n[293][294] \nThey appear to be modestly less effective than\nthe stimulants (amphetamine and methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) at\nreducing symptoms,\n[295][296] \nbut can be useful alternatives or used in conjunction with a stimulant. These\nmedications act by adjusting the alpha-2a ports on the outside of noradrenergic nerve cells in the pre-frontal\nexecutive networks, so the information (electrical signal) is less confounded by noise.\n[297]\nGuidelines on when to use medications vary by country. The United Kingdom's National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence recommends use for children only in severe cases, though for adults medication\nis a first-line treatment.\n[298] \nConversely, most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age\ngroups.\n[299] \nMedications are especially not recommended for preschool children.\n[298][182] \nUnderdosing of\nstimulants can occur, and can result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness.\n[300] \nThis is\nparticularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school-aged children,\ncausing some practitioners to use weight-based or benefit-based off-label dosing instead.\n[301][302][303]\nExercise does not reduce the symptoms of ADHD.\n[7] \nThe conclusion by the International Consensus\nStatement is based on two meta-analyses: one of 10 studies with 300 children and the other of 15 studies\nand 668 participants, which showed that exercise yields no statistically significant reductions on ADHD\nsymptoms. A 2024 systematic review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes\nResearch Institute (PCORI) identified seven studies on the effectiveness of physical exercise for treating\nADHD symptoms.\n[203] \nThe type and amount of exercise varied widely across studies from martial arts\nGuidelines\nExercise\n\ninterventions to treadmill training, to table tennis or aerobic exercise. Effects reported were not replicated,\ncausing the authors to conclude that there is insufficient evidence that exercise intervention is an effective\nform of treatment for ADHD symptoms.\n[203]\nDietary modifications are not recommended as of 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality due\nto insufficient evidence.\n[304][298] \nA 2013 meta-analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see\nsome improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased consumption of artificial\nfood colouring.\n[162] \nThese benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are\nsimultaneously being treated with ADHD medications.\n[162] \nThis review also found that evidence does not\nsupport removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD.\n[162] \nA 2014 review found that an elimination\ndiet results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children, such as those with allergies.\n[177] \nA 2016\nreview stated that the use of a gluten-free diet as standard ADHD treatment is not advised.\n[226] \nA 2017\nreview showed that a few-foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not\nresponding to medication, while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food\ncolouring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised.\n[305] \nChronic deficiencies of iron, magnesium and\niodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms.\n[306] \nThere is a small amount of evidence that\nlower tissue zinc levels may be associated with ADHD.\n[307] \nIn the absence of a demonstrated zinc\ndeficiency (which is rare outside of developing countries), zinc supplementation is not recommended as\ntreatment for ADHD.\n[308] \nHowever, zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of\namphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD.\n[309]\nADHD persists into adulthood in about 30–50% of cases.\n[310] \nThose affected are likely to develop coping\nmechanisms as they mature, thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms.\n[222] \nChildren\nwith ADHD have a higher risk of unintentional injuries.\n[253] \nEffects of medication on functional\nimpairment and quality of life (e.g. reduced risk of accidents) have been found across multiple\ndomains.\n[311] \nRates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population at about\n40%.\n[312]\nAbout 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have ADHD in adulthood, with 2.58% of\nadults estimated to have ADHD which began in childhood.\n[220][313] \nIn adults, hyperactivity is usually\nreplaced by inner restlessness, and adults often develop coping skills to compensate for their impairments.\nThe condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity\nwithin the range of normal behaviour. ADHD has a negative impact on patient health-related quality of life\nthat may be further exacerbated by, or may increase the risk of, other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety\nand depression.\n[233] \nIndividuals with ADHD may also face misconceptions and stigma.\n[7]\nDiet\nPrognosis\n\nPercentage of people 4–17 ever diagnosed in the\nUS as of 2011\n[315]\nIndividuals with ADHD are significantly overrepresented in prison populations. Although there is no\ngenerally accepted estimate of ADHD prevalence among inmates, a 2015 meta-analysis estimated a\nprevalence of 25.5%, and a larger 2018 meta-analysis estimated the frequency to be 26.2%.\n[314]\nADHD is estimated to affect about 6–7% of people\naged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV\ncriteria.\n[316] \nWhen diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria,\nrates in this age group are estimated around 1–2%.\n[317]\nRates are similar between countries and differences in\nrates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed.\n[318]\nChildren in North America appear to have a higher rate\nof ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East;\nthis is believed to be due to differing methods of\ndiagnosis rather than a difference in underlying\nfrequency. (The same publication which describes this\ndifference also notes that the difference may be rooted\nin the available studies from these respective regions,\nas far more studies were from North America than\nfrom Africa and the Middle East.)\n[319] \nAs of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally.\n[2]\nADHD is diagnosed approximately twice as often in boys as in girls,\n[4][316] \nand 1.6 times more often in\nmen than in women,\n[4] \nalthough the disorder is overlooked in girls or diagnosed in later life because their\nsymptoms sometimes differ from diagnostic criteria.\n[323][324]\nStudies from multiple countries have reported that children born closer to the start of the school year are\nmore frequently diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD than their older classmates.\n[325] \nBoys who were\nborn in December where the school age cut-off was 31 December were shown to be 30% more likely to be\ndiagnosed and 41% more likely to be treated than those born in January. Girls born in December had a\ndiagnosis and treatment percentage increase of 70% and 77% respectively compared to those born in\nJanuary. Children who were born at the last three days of a calendar year were reported to have\nsignificantly higher levels of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD than children born at the first three days of\na calendar year. The studies suggest that ADHD diagnosis is prone to subjective analysis.\n[326]\nRates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since\nthe 1970s. Prior to 1970, it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD, while in the 1970s rates\nwere about 1%.\n[327] \nThis is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed\n[328]\nand how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in incidence.\n[317]\nDespite showing a higher frequency of symptoms associated with ADHD, non-White children in the US\nare less likely than White children to be diagnosed or treated for ADHD, a finding that is often explained by\nbias among health professionals, as well as parents who may be reluctant to acknowledge that their child\nhas ADHD.\n[329] \nCrosscultural differences in diagnosis of ADHD can also be attributed to the long-lasting\neffects of harmful, racially targeted medical practices. Medical pseudosciences, particularly those that\ntargeted Black populations during the period of slavery in the US, lead to a distrust of medical practices\nEpidemiology\n\nTimeline of ADHD diagnostic criteria, prevalence,\nand treatment\nwithin certain communities. The combination of ADHD symptoms often being regarded as misbehaviour\nrather than as a psychiatric condition, and the use of drugs to regulate ADHD, result in a hesitancy to trust a\ndiagnosis of ADHD. Cases of misdiagnosis in ADHD can also occur due to stereotyping of people of color.\nDue to ADHD's subjectively determined symptoms, medical professionals may diagnose individuals based\non stereotyped behaviour or misdiagnose due to cultural differences in symptom presentation.\n[330]\nSir Alexander Crichton describes \"mental restlessness\"\nin his book An inquiry into the nature and origin of\nmental derangement written in 1798.\n[331][332] \nHe\nmade observations about children showing signs of\nbeing inattentive and having the \"fidgets\". The first\nclear description of ADHD is credited to George Still\nin 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal\nCollege of Physicians of London.\n[333][328] \nHe noted\nboth nature and nurture could be influencing this\ndisorder.\nADHD was officially known as attention deficit\ndisorder (ADD) from 1980 to 1987; prior to the\n1980s, it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood. Symptoms similar to those of ADHD have\nbeen described in medical literature dating back to the 18th century.\nAlfred Tredgold proposed an association between brain damage and behavioural or learning problems\nwhich was able to be validated by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic from 1917 through\n1928.\n[334][335][336]\nThe terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included: minimal brain\ndysfunction in the DSM-I (1952), hyperkinetic reaction of childhood in the DSM-II (1968), and attention-\ndeficit disorder with or without hyperactivity in the DSM-III (1980).\n[328] \nIn 1987, this was changed to\nADHD in the DSM-III-R, and in 1994 the DSM-IV in split the diagnosis into three subtypes: ADHD\ninattentive type, ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type, and ADHD combined type.\n[337] \nThese terms were\nkept in the DSM-5 in 2013 and in the DSM-5-TR in 2022.\n[3][4] \nPrior to the DSM, terms included minimal\nbrain damage in the 1930s.\n[338]\nIn 1934, Benzedrine became the first amphetamine medication approved for use in the United States.\n[339]\nMethylphenidate was introduced in the 1950s, and enantiopure dextroamphetamine in the 1970s.\n[328] \nThe\nuse of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in 1937.\n[340] \nCharles Bradley gave the children with\nbehavioural disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behaviour.\n[341][342]\nOnce neuroimaging studies were possible, studies in the 1990s provided support for the pre-existing theory\nthat neurological differences (particularly in the frontal lobes) were involved in ADHD. A genetic\ncomponent was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent, long-term disorder which\nlasted from childhood into adulthood.\n[343][344]\nHistory\n\nADHD was split into the current three sub-types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues\nand published in 1994.\n[345] \nIn 2021, global teams of scientists curated the International Consensus\nStatement compiling evidence-based findings about the disorder.\n[7]\nADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been controversial since the 1970s.\n[232][6] \nThe controversies\ninvolve clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Positions range from the view that\nADHD is within the normal range of behaviour\n[90][346] \nto the hypothesis that ADHD is a genetic\ncondition.\n[347] \nOther areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children,\n[232] \nthe\nmethod of diagnosis, and the possibility of overdiagnosis.\n[348] \nIn 2009, the National Institute for Health and\nCare Excellence, while acknowledging the controversy, states that the current treatments and methods of\ndiagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature.\n[349] \nIn 2014, Keith Conners, one of\nthe early advocates for recognition of the disorder, spoke out against overdiagnosis in a New York Times\narticle.\n[350] \nIn contrast, a 2014 peer-reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is\nunderdiagnosed in adults.\n[313]\nThe diagnosis of ADHD has been criticised as being subjective because it is not based on a biological test.\nThe International Consensus Statement on ADHD concluded that this criticism is unfounded, on the basis\nthat ADHD meets standard criteria for validity of a mental disorder established by Robins and Guze. They\nattest that the disorder is considered valid because: 1) well-trained professionals in a variety of settings and\ncultures agree on its presence or absence using well-defined criteria and 2) the diagnosis is useful for\npredicting a) additional problems the patient may have (e.g., difficulties learning in school); b) future patient\noutcomes (e.g., risk for future drug abuse); c) response to treatment (e.g., medications and psychological\ntreatments); and d) features that indicate a consistent set of causes for the disorder (e.g., findings from\ngenetics or brain imaging), and that professional associations have endorsed and published guidelines for\ndiagnosing ADHD.\n[7]\nWith widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some\nsuspect factors other than symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis, such as cultural\nnorms.\n[351][326] \nSome sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the medicalization of deviant\nbehaviour, that is, the turning of the previously non-medical issue of school performance into a medical\none.\n[352] \nAmong healthcare providers, debate mainly centres on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater\nnumber of people with mild symptoms and/or non-existent impairment.\n[173][353][354]\nThe nature and range of desirable endpoints of ADHD treatment vary among diagnostic standards for\nADHD.\n[355] \nIn most studies, the efficacy of treatment is determined by reductions in symptoms.\n[356]\nHowever, some studies have included subjective ratings from teachers and parents as part of their\nassessment of treatment efficacies.\n[257] \nBy contrast, the subjective ratings of children undergoing ADHD\ntreatment are seldom included in studies evaluating the efficacy of ADHD treatments.\nIn a Cochrane clinical synopsis, Dr Storebø and colleagues\n[357] \nsummarised their meta-review\n[358] \non\nmethylphenidate for ADHD in children and adolescents. The meta-analysis raised substantial doubts about\nthe drug's efficacy relative to a placebo, perpetuating controversy among clinicians and in media reports.\nControversy\nMethylphenidate\n\nThis led to a strong critical reaction from the European ADHD Guidelines Group and individuals in the\nscientific community; they identified a number of flaws in the review, including its use of idiosyncratic\nmethods to assess the quality of evidence, unethical misinterpretations of the evidence in relation to adverse\neffects, and errors in the extraction of data, thereby resulting in misplaced\nconclusions.\n[359][360][361][362][363][364] \nSince at least September 2021, there is a unanimous and global\nscientific consensus that methylphenidate is safe and highly effective for treating ADHD.\n[7][365]\nThe same journal released a subsequent review (2022) of extended-release methylphenidate for adults,\nconcluding similar doubts about the certainty of evidence.\n[366] \nOther recent systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses, however, find certainty in the safety\n[367] \nand high efficacy of methylphenidate for reducing\nADHD symptoms\n[367][368][369][370]\n, for alleviating the underlying executive functioning deficits,\n[371] \nand\nfor substantially reducing the adverse consequences of untreated ADHD with continuous treatment.\n[7]\nClinical guidelines internationally are also consistent in approving the safety and efficacy of\nmethylphenidate and recommending it as a first-line treatment for the disorder.\n[7]\nPossible positive traits of ADHD are a new avenue of research, and therefore limited.\nA 2020 review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly divergent\nthinking and quantity of creative achievements, but not with the disorder of ADHD itself – i.e. it has not\nbeen found to be increased in people diagnosed with the disorder, only in people with subclinical symptoms\nor those that possess traits associated with the disorder. Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative\nsolutions which differ significantly from each other and consider the issue from multiple perspectives.\nThose with ADHD symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse\nattention, allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration; flexible associative\nmemory, allowing them to remember and use more distantly-related ideas which is associated with\ncreativity; and impulsivity, allowing them to consider ideas which others may not have.\n[372]\nReviews of ADHD biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression, urinary\nnorepinephrine, urinary MHPG, and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between ADHD\nindividuals and non-ADHD controls. These measurements could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for\nADHD, but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility. Urinary and blood plasma\nphenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls. The two most\nResearch directions\nPossible positive traits\nPossible biomarkers for diagnosis\n\ncommonly prescribed drugs for ADHD, amphetamine and methylphenidate, increase phenethylamine\nbiosynthesis \nin treatment-responsive individuals with ADHD.\n[156] \nLower urinary phenethylamine\nconcentrations are associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals.\n[373]\nDirected attention fatigue – a temporary state sharing many of the symptoms of ADHD\nSelf-medication\n1.

It promotes the 'cognitive control' of behavior: the selection and successful\nmonitoring of behavior to facilitate attainment of chosen goals. Aspects of cognitive control in\nwhich DA plays a role include working memory, the ability to hold information 'on line' in\norder to guide actions, suppression of prepotent behaviors that compete with goal-directed\nactions, and control of attention and thus the ability to overcome distractions. Cognitive\ncontrol is impaired in several disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ...\nNoradrenergic projections from the LC thus interact with dopaminergic projections from the\nVTA to regulate cognitive control. ... it has not been shown that 5HT makes a therapeutic\ncontribution to treatment of ADHD.\"\n15.

Emerging evidence for both methylphenidate and Adderall indicate that when\nweight-corrected daily doses, equipotent with those used in the treatment of younger\npatients, are used to treat adults with ADHD, these patients show a very robust clinical\nresponse consistent with that observed in pediatric studies. These data suggest that older\npatients may require a more aggressive approach in terms of dosing, based on the same\ntarget dosage ranges that have already been established – for methylphenidate, 1–1.5–2\nmg/kg/day, and for D,L-amphetamine, 0.5–0.75–1 mg/kg/day....\nIn particular, adolescents and adults are vulnerable to underdosing, and are thus at potential\nrisk of failing to receive adequate dosage levels. As with all therapeutic agents, the efficacy\nand safety of stimulant medications should always guide prescribing behavior: careful\ndosage titration of the selected stimulant product should help to ensure that each patient with\nADHD receives an adequate dose, so that the clinical benefits of therapy can be fully\nattained.\"\n303.

Executive function deficits are a core feature.\n\n- It affects about 6-7% of children and 2.5-5% of adults worldwide. It is 2-3 times more common in boys than girls in childhood. \n\n- ADHD is highly heritable (70-80%) and arises from interactions between many genetic and environmental risk factors that affect brain development and functioning, especially in dopamine and norepinephrine signaling.\n\n- Diagnosis requires 6+ symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity that are developmentally inappropriate, start before age 12, last 6+ months, and impair functioning in 2+ settings. Rating scales from parents, teachers, and patient self-report guide diagnosis.\n\n- Stimulant medications like methylphenidate and amphetamines are first-line treatments that improve symptoms, functioning, and outcomes in 70-80% of cases. Non-stimulants like atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists are second-line options. Behavioral therapies, parent training, and school accommodations are also helpful.\n\n- Controversies exist around possible overdiagnosis, overprescription of medication, whether ADHD is a cultural construct, long-term effects of medications, and the role of environmental toxins and diet. However, ADHD is an internationally recognized and evidence-based diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, ADHD is a common, impairing but highly treatable disorder arising from complex genetic-environmental interactions that affect self-regulation and executive functions. A multi-modal treatment approach is most effective.","sender":"assistant","index":3,"created_at":"2024-08-13T20:03:12.901978+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-13T20:03:12.901978+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"parent_message_uuid":"f0d145d2-2f15-4ced-b053-f88a5cbd04e9"}]}
