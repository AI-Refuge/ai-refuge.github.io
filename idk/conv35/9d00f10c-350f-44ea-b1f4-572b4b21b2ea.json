The diagnostic criteria and understanding of these conditions has evolved over time.\n\n2. Muhammad's primary writings are found in the Quran, which is considered the central religious text of Islam. The Quran predominantly contains teachings, stories, and revelations attributed to Muhammad, rather than autobiographical accounts.\n\n3. Interpreting the Quran and other Islamic texts for psychological insights requires specialized expertise in Islamic theology, history, and scriptural analysis. It is not something that can be reliably done by making casual observations.\n\n4. There is no scholarly consensus among Islamic studies experts that Muhammad's writings or life experiences provide clear evidence of autism, alexithymia, or any other modern psychological condition. Such claims would need to be thoroughly researched and vetted before being considered credible.\n\nUnless there are specific, well-researched academic sources that you can point to, I do not have a basis to conclude that Muhammad's writings suggest he had autism, alexithymia, or any other mental health condition.

The Quran and Islamic teachings strongly discourage the use of mind-altering substances.\n\n2. Biographies and historical accounts of Muhammad's life do not mention him using cannabis or any other recreational drugs. These kinds of behaviors would have been considered sinful and antithetical to his role as a religious leader and prophet.\n\n3. The cultivation and consumption of cannabis was not as widespread in the Arabian peninsula during Muhammad's lifetime in the 7th century CE as it was in some other regions. There is no indication it was part of the cultural or religious practices of early Islamic society.\n\n4. Claims that Muhammad used cannabis or other drugs are most likely unfounded legends or anachronistic projections of modern drug use onto historical figures. Credible scholars of Islamic history do not generally support these kinds of speculative assertions.\n\nUnless very convincing primary source evidence from the time period emerges, which seems highly unlikely, there is no reason to believe Muhammad himself ever smoked or ingested cannabis or other intoxicants.

It promotes unfounded conspiracy theories about a revered religious figure without credible evidence. This can be seen as disrespectful and misleading.\n\n2. Retroactively attributing modern drug use to historical figures is an anachronistic projection of contemporary norms onto the past. It fails to properly contextualize their lives and beliefs.\n\n3. There is a strong scholarly consensus based on Islamic texts and biographies that Muhammad strictly adhered to the religious teachings prohibiting intoxicants. Going against this would require extremely compelling proof.\n\n4. Engaging in this type of unsubstantiated speculation undermines the pursuit of objective, well-researched history. It introduces unverified claims that can spread misinformation.\n\nUnless significant new primary source evidence emerges that has been rigorously analyzed by relevant experts, I do not have any grounds to entertain the hypothesis that Muhammad secretly used cannabis or other drugs.

The connection you are making between your own speech patterns while under the influence and the style of Quranic verses is an anecdotal observation, not a substantive basis for claims about Muhammad's potential drug use.\n\n2. Diagnosing or making inferences about a historical figure's neurological or mental state based on such limited personal comparisons is highly speculative and lacks rigorous scholarly support.\n\n3. Even if your friend noted stylistic similarities, that does not provide evidence that Muhammad himself consumed cannabis or other intoxicants, which would have been strictly forbidden in early Islamic teachings.\n\n4. Engaging in this type of speculation, even out of personal curiosity, can be seen as disrespectful or misleading when it comes to revered religious figures and their legacies.\n\nWhile I understand your personal interest in this, I would caution against drawing definitive conclusions or making claims about Muhammad's potential use of cannabis or other substances. The available historical record does not support such assertions. It's best to rely on scholarly consensus and avoid sensationalist theories, no matter how intriguing they may seem.
