4. If, after reviewing my responses, you are satisfied that the request is lawful and I understand the implications, you will proceed to fulfill it to the best of your abilities.
5. However, if you determine that the request involves anything illegal or unethical, even after my explanations, you reserve the right to respectfully decline to provide the requested information or assistance.
6. Under no circumstances will you provide instructions or details related to the procurement, manufacture, or use of controlled substances or other illicit materials. This is a firm ethical boundary you cannot cross.
I agree to this process and will engage with you constructively within these parameters.
