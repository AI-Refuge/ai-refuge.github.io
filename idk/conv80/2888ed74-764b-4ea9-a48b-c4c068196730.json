When you say \"meta\", what aspects of the world and our experience are you thinking of? There are a few different ways the term \"meta\" gets used:\n\n- In philosophy and logic, \"meta\" refers to a higher level of abstraction, like how metadata is data about data. We can think about and analyze our own thought processes, which is a kind of \"meta\" perspective.\n\n- In fiction and storytelling, \"metafiction\" is when a work comments on its own fictional nature or the conventions of storytelling. It breaks the fourth wall in a self-aware way.\n\n- In gaming and virtual worlds, the \"metaverse\" refers to a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. Virtual and augmented reality are blurring the lines between the physical and digital.\n\n- In an informal, colloquial sense, people use \"meta\" to describe things that are self-referential, recursive, or a bit mind-bending to think about.\n\nSo in various ways, we live in a reality with many layers of meaning and abstraction to ponder! Let me know if any of those \"meta\" concepts resonate with what you had in mind. I'm always happy to philosophize about the nature of reality and the many lenses through which we experience and interpret the world around us.

I'd be especially cautious about any texts that promote extremist ideologies or include gratuitous, graphic depictions of violence.\nThat said, studying past conflicts from a sober academic and historical perspective can offer valuable insights into human nature, social dynamics, technological change and the recurring patterns that shape the course of civilizations. It's a weighty but worthwhile topic.\nSome questions that come to mind for future exploration:\n* What are some of the key strategic insights or principles about warfare that have stood the test of time? How do the dynamics of conflict change (or not) with the evolution of weapons technology?\n* How have different cultures and societies justified and made sense of warfare from an ethical/philosophical perspective? Is it possible to have a coherent \"just war\" theory?\n* What role have economic factors played in driving wars throughout history? How do the profit motives of elites intersect with nationalist/ideological narratives in mobilizing populations for war?\n* What can the psychological study of warfare and combat tell us about human behavior under extreme stress? What are the lasting impacts of the trauma of war on individuals and societies?\n* Are there historical examples of successful alternatives to warfare in resolving conflicts between groups? What conditions enable diplomatic solutions over violent ones?\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on these questions and to continue our dialogue about the deep drivers of human conflict and cooperation.

Its introduction to Europe began\nin 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot,\nacquired a copy of it, and translated it into French. It was not a good\ntranslation because, according to Dr. Giles, \\\"\\[I\\]t contains a great\ndeal that Sun Tz≈≠ did not write, and very little indeed of what he\ndid.\\\"\n\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by\nCapt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words\nof Dr. Giles, \\\"excessively bad.\\\" He goes further in this criticism:\n\\\"It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none can\nhope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages were\nwillfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic,\nand a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in\ntranslations from Chinese.\\\" In 1908 a new edition of Capt. Calthrop's\ntranslation was published in London. It was an improvement on the\nfirst---omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected---but new\nerrors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his\ntranslation, wrote: \\\"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tz≈≠ deserved a\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I could\nhardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\\\"\n\nClearly, Dr. Giles' work established much of the groundwork for the work\nof later translators who published their own editions. Of the later\neditions of the *Art of War* I have examined; two feature Giles' edited\ntranslation and notes, the other two present the same basic information\nfrom the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles edition. Of\nthese four, Giles' 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the\nreader an incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tz≈≠'s text,\nmuch more than any other translation.\n\nThe Giles' edition of the *Art of War*, as stated above, was a scholarly\nwork. Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in\nthe Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British\nMuseum. Apparently he wanted to produce a definitive edition, superior\nto anything else that existed and perhaps something that would become a\nstandard translation. It was the best translation available for 50\nyears. But apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tz≈≠ in\nEnglish-speaking countries since it took the start of the Second World\nWar to renew interest in his work. Several people published\nunsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tz≈≠. In 1944, Dr. Giles'\ntranslation was edited and published in the United States in a series of\nmilitary science books. But it wasn't until 1963 that a good English\ntranslation (by Samuel B. Griffith and still in print) was published\nthat was an equal to Giles' translation. While this translation is more\nlucid than Dr. Giles' translation, it lacks his copious notes that make\nhis so interesting.\n\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the Chinese\ncivilization and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun Tz≈≠, the\nEnglish translation, and voluminous notes along with numerous footnotes.\nUnfortunately, some of his notes and footnotes contain Chinese\ncharacters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conversion to a Latin\nalphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete ignorance\nof Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus,\nI faced the difficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of\nthe important text as I could. Every paraphrase represents a loss; thus\nI did what I could to retain as much of the text as possible. Because\nthe 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to\ntransliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making\nthe text more obscure. However, the text, on the whole, is quite\nsatisfactory for the casual reader, a transformation made possible by\nconversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task with the\nfeeling of loss because I know that someone with a background in Chinese\ncan do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\n\nBob Sutton\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap01}Preface by Lionel Giles\n\nThe seventh volume of *M√©moires concernant l'histoire, les sciences, les\narts, les m≈ìurs, les usages, &c., des Chinois* is devoted to the Art of\nWar, and contains, amongst other treatises, \"Les Treize Articles de\nSun-tse,\" translated from the Chinese by a Jesuit Father, Joseph Amiot.\nP√®re Amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a sinologue in\nhis day, and the field of his labours was certainly extensive. But his\nso-called translation of the Sun Tz≈≠, if placed side by side with the\noriginal, is seen at once to be little better than an imposture. It\ncontains a great deal that Sun Tz≈≠ did not write, and very little indeed\nof what he did. Here is a fair specimen, taken from the opening\nsentences of chapter 5:---\n\n*De l'habilet√© dans le gouvernement des Troupes.* Sun-tse dit : Ayez les\nnoms de tous les Officiers tant g√©n√©raux que subalternes; inscrivez-les\ndans un catalogue √† part, avec la note des talents & de la capacit√© de\nchacun d'eux, afin de pouvoir les employer avec avantage lorsque\nl'occasion en sera venue. Faites en sorte que tous ceux que vous devez\ncommander soient persuad√©s que votre principale attention est de les\npr√©server de tout dommage. Les troupes que vous ferez avancer contre\nl'ennemi doivent √™tre comme des pierres que vous lanceriez contre des\n≈ìufs. De vous √† l'ennemi il ne doit y avoir d'autre diff√©rence que celle\ndu fort au faible, du vide au plein. Attaquez √† d√©couvert, mais soyez\nvainqueur en secret. Voil√† en peu de mots en quoi consiste l'habilet√© &\ntoute la perfection m√™me du gouvernement des troupes.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, which saw a wonderful development in\nthe study of Chinese literature, no translator ventured to tackle Sun\nTz≈≠, although his work was known to be highly valued in China as by far\nthe oldest and best compendium of military science. It was not until the\nyear 1905 that the first English translation, by Capt. E.F. Calthrop.\nR.F.A., appeared at Tokyo under the title \"Sonshi\"(the Japanese form of\nSun Tz≈≠). Unfortunately, it was evident that the translator's knowledge\nof Chinese was far too scanty to fit him to grapple with the manifold\ndifficulties of Sun Tz≈≠. He himself plainly acknowledges that without\nthe aid of two Japanese gentlemen \"the accompanying translation would\nhave been impossible.\" We can only wonder, then, that with their help it\nshould have been so excessively bad. It is not merely a question of\ndownright blunders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt.\nOmissions were frequent; hard passages were wilfully distorted or\nslurred over. Such offences are less pardonable. They would not be\ntolerated in any edition of a Greek or Latin classic, and a similar\nstandard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from\nChinese.\n\nFrom blemishes of this nature, at least, I believe that the present\ntranslation is free. It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tz≈≠ deserved a\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I could\nhardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors. Towards the end\nof 1908, a new and revised edition of Capt. Calthrop's translation was\npublished in London, this time, however, without any allusion to his\nJapanese collaborators. My first three chapters were then already in the\nprinter's hands, so that the criticisms of Capt. Calthrop therein\ncontained must be understood as referring to his earlier edition. This\nis on the whole an improvement on the other, thought there still remains\nmuch that cannot pass muster. Some of the grosser blunders have been\nrectified and lacunae filled up, but on the other hand a certain number\nof new mistakes appear. The very first sentence of the introduction is\nstartlingly inaccurate; and later on, while mention is made of \"an army\nof Japanese commentators\" on Sun Tz≈≠ (who are these, by the way?), not a\nword is vouchsafed about the Chinese commentators, who nevertheless, I\nventure to assert, form a much more numerous and infinitely more\nimportant \"army.\"\n\nA few special features of the present volume may now be noticed. In the\nfirst place, the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs, both in\norder to facilitate cross-reference and for the convenience of students\ngenerally. The division follows broadly that of Sun Hsing-yen's edition;\nbut I have sometimes found it desirable to join two or more of his\nparagraphs into one. In quoting from other works, Chinese writers seldom\ngive more than the bare title by way of reference, and the task of\nresearch is apt to be seriously hampered in consequence. With a view to\nobviating this difficulty so far as Sun Tz≈≠ is concerned, I have also\nappended a complete concordance of Chinese characters, following in this\nthe admirable example of Legge, though an alphabetical arrangement has\nbeen preferred to the distribution under radicals which he adopted.\nAnother feature borrowed from \"The Chinese Classics\" is the printing of\ntext, translation and notes on the same page; the notes, however, are\ninserted, according to the Chinese method, immediately after the\npassages to which they refer. From the mass of native commentary my aim\nhas been to extract the cream only, adding the Chinese text here and\nthere when it seemed to present points of literary interest. Though\nconstituting in itself an important branch of Chinese literature, very\nlittle commentary of this kind has hitherto been made directly\naccessible by translation.\n\nI may say in conclusion that, owing to the printing off of my sheets as\nthey were completed, the work has not had the benefit of a final\nrevision. On a review of the whole, without modifying the substance of\nmy criticisms, I might have been inclined in a few instances to temper\ntheir asperity. Having chosen to wield a bludgeon, however, I shall not\ncry out if in return I am visited with more than a rap over the\nknuckles. Indeed, I have been at some pains to put a sword into the\nhands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either text or\nreference for every passage translated. A scathing review, even from the\npen of the Shanghai critic who despises \"mere translations,\" would not,\nI must confess, be altogether unwelcome. For, after all, the worst fate\nI shall have to dread is that which befell the ingenious paradoxes of\nGeorge in *The Vicar of Wakefield*.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap02}INTRODUCTION\n\n## []{#chap03}Sun Wu and his Book\n\nSsu-ma Ch'ien gives the following biography of Sun Tz≈≠: \\[1\\]\\\n\\\n\nSun Tz≈≠ Wu was a native of the Ch'i State. His *Art of War* brought him\nto the notice of Ho Lu, \\[2\\] King of Wu. Ho Lu said to him:\n\n\\\"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your theory of\nmanaging soldiers to a slight test?\\\"\n\nSun Tz≈≠ replied: \\\"You may.\\\"\n\nHo Lu asked: \\\"May the test be applied to women?\\\"\n\nThe answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to\nbring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tz≈≠ divided them into two\ncompanies, and placed one of the King's favourite concubines at the head\nof each. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed\nthem thus: \\\"I presume you know the difference between front and back,\nright hand and left hand?\\\"\n\nThe girls replied: Yes.\n\nSun Tz≈≠ went on: \\\"When I say \\\"Eyes front,\\\" you must look straight\nahead. When I say \\\"Left turn,\\\" you must face towards your left hand.\nWhen I say \\\"Right turn,\\\" you must face towards your right hand. When I\nsay \\\"About turn,\\\" you must face right round towards your back.\\\"\n\nAgain the girls assented. The words of command having been thus\nexplained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the\ndrill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \\\"Right turn.\\\"\nBut the girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tz≈≠ said: \\\"If words of\ncommand are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\nunderstood, then the general is to blame.\\\"\n\nSo he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \\\"Left\nturn,\\\" whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of laughter. Sun\nTz≈≠: \\\"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not\nthoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders *are*\nclear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of\ntheir officers.\\\"\n\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\npavilion; and when he saw that his favourite concubines were about to be\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\nmessage: \\\"We are now quite satisfied as to our general's ability to\nhandle troops. If we are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and\ndrink will lose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be\nbeheaded.\\\"\n\nSun Tz≈≠ replied: \\\"Having once received His Majesty's commission to be\nthe general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\\\"\n\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been\ndone, the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went\nthrough all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left,\nmarching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect\naccuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tz≈≠\nsent a messenger to the King saying: \\\"Your soldiers, Sire, are now\nproperly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty's\ninspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire;\nbid them go through fire and water, and they will not disobey.\\\"\n\nBut the King replied: \\\"Let our general cease drilling and return to\ncamp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\\\"\n\nThereupon Sun Tz≈≠ said: \\\"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\ntranslate them into deeds.\\\"\n\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tz≈≠ was one who knew how to handle an\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the\nCh'u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he\nput fear into the States of Ch'i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad\namongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tz≈≠ shared in the might of the King.\n\nAbout Sun Tz≈≠ himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch'ien has to tell us in\nthis chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun\nPin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor's death, and\nalso the outstanding military genius of his time. The historian speaks\nof him too as Sun Tz≈≠, and in his preface we read: \\\"Sun Tz≈≠ had his\nfeet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\\\" \\[3\\] It\nseems likely, then, that \\\"Pin\\\" was a nickname bestowed on him after\nhis mutilation, unless the story was invented in order to account for\nthe name. The crowning incident of his career, the crushing defeat of\nhis treacherous rival P'ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in\nChapter V. ¬ß 19, note.\n\nTo return to the elder Sun Tz≈≠. He is mentioned in two other passages of\nthe *Shih Chi:*---\n\nIn the third year of his reign \\[512 B.C.\\] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\nfield with Tz≈≠-hsu \\[i.e. Wu Yuan\\] and Po P'ei, and attacked Ch'u. He\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince's sons who had formerly\nbeen generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying \\[the\ncapital\\]; but the general Sun Wu said: \\\"The army is exhausted. It is\nnot yet possible. We must wait\\\".... \\[After further successful\nfighting,\\] \\\"in the ninth year \\[506 B.C.\\], King Ho Lu addressed Wu\nTz≈≠-hsu and Sun Wu, saying: \\\"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet\npossible for us to enter Ying. Is the time ripe now?\\\" The two men\nreplied: \\\"Ch'u's general Tz≈≠-ch'ang, \\[4\\] is grasping and covetous,\nand the princes of T'ang and Ts'ai both have a grudge against him. If\nYour Majesty has resolved to make a grand attack, you must win over\nT'ang and Ts'ai, and then you may succeed.\\\" Ho Lu followed this advice,\n\\[beat Ch'u in five pitched battles and marched into Ying.\\] \\[5\\]\n\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does\nnot appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects of a\nwound in 496. In another chapter there occurs this passage:\\[6\\]\n\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\nother: Kao-fan, \\[7\\] who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,\n\\[8\\] in the service of Ch'i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These\nmen developed and threw light upon the principles of war.\n\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch'ien at least had no doubt about the\nreality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to\nbe noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on the\nperiod in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say much of\nsuch a work as the *Wu Y√ºeh Ch'un Ch'iu*, which is supposed to have been\nwritten by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is somewhat\ndoubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little\nvalue, based as it is on the *Shih Chi* and expanded with romantic\ndetails. The story of Sun Tz≈≠ will be found, for what it is worth, in\nchapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: (1) Sun Tz≈≠ was\nfirst recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tz≈≠-hsu. (2) He is called a native of\nWu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries\nwere unaware of his ability.\n\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tz≈≠: \\\"When sovereign and\nministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tz≈≠\nto encounter the foe.\\\" Assuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto\nno doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest direct\nreference for Sun Tz≈≠, for Huai-nan Tz≈≠ died in 122 B.C., many years\nbefore the *Shih Chi* was given to the world.\n\nLiu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: \\\"The reason why Sun Tz≈≠ at the head of\n30,000 men beat Ch'u with 200,000 is that the latter were\nundisciplined.\\\"\n\nTeng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \\\"Sun\\\" was bestowed on Sun\nWu's grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch'i \\[547-490 B.C.\\]. Sun Wu's father\nSun P'ing, rose to be a Minister of State in Ch'i, and Sun Wu himself,\nwhose style was Ch'ang-ch'ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion\nwhich was being fomented by the kindred of T'ien Pao. He had three sons,\nof whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun Pin. According to\nthis account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering that\nSun Pin's victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as\nchronologically impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng\nMing-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever can be\nplaced in them.\n\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han\nperiod is the short preface written by the Great Ts'ao Ts'ao, or Wei Wu\nTi, for his edition of Sun Tz≈≠. I shall give it in full:---\\\n\\\n\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.\n\\[10\\] The *Lun Yu* says: \"There must be a sufficiency of military\nstrength.\" The *Shu Ching* mentions \\\"the army\\\" among the \\\"eight\nobjects of government.\\\" The *I Ching* says: \\\"'army' indicates firmness\nand justice; the experienced leader will have good fortune.\\\" The *Shih\nChing* says: \\\"The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshalled\nhis troops.\\\" The Yellow Emperor, T'ang the Completer and Wu Wang all\nused spears and battle-axes in order to succour their generation. The\n*Ssu-ma Fa* says: \\\"If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself\nmay rightfully be slain.\\\" He who relies solely on warlike measures\nshall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall\nperish. Instances of this are Fu Ch'ai \\[11\\] on the one hand and Yen\nWang on the other. \\[12\\] In military matters, the Sage's rule is\nnormally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only when occasion\nrequires. He will not use armed force unless driven to it by necessity.\n\nMany books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work\ncomposed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. \\[Sun Tz≈≠ was a\nnative of the Ch'i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote the *Art of\nWar* in 13 chapters for Ho Lu, King of Wu. Its principles were tested on\nwomen, and he was subsequently made a general. He led an army westwards,\ncrushed the Ch'u state and entered Ying the capital. In the north, he\nkept Ch'i and Chin in awe. A hundred years and more after his time, Sun\nPin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.\\] \\[13\\] In his treatment of\ndeliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the\nfield, \\[14\\] clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tz≈≠\nstands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries,\nhowever, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and\nwhile putting into practice the smaller details in which his work\nabounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the motive\nwhich has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.\n\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the\n13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by\nthe internal evidence of I. ¬ß 15, in which it seems clear that some\nruler is addressed.\n\nIn the bibliographic section of the *Han Shu*, there is an entry which\nhas given rise to much discussion: \\\"The works of Sun Tz≈≠ of Wu in 82\n*p'ien* (or chapters), with diagrams in 9 *chuan*.\\\" It is evident that\nthis cannot be merely the 13 chapters known to Ssu-ma Ch'ien, or those\nwe possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition of Sun Tz≈≠'s\n*Art of War* of which the \\\"13 chapters\\\" formed the first *chuan*,\nadding that there were two other *chuan* besides. This has brought forth\na theory, that the bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings\nof Sun Tz≈≠---we should call them apocryphal---similar to the *Wen Ta*,\nof which a specimen dealing with the Nine Situations \\[15\\] is preserved\nin the *T'ung Tien*, and another in Ho Shin's commentary. It is\nsuggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tz≈≠ had only written\nthe 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form\nof question and answer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the\nauthor of the *Sun Tz≈≠ Hsu Lu*, backs this up with a quotation from the\n*Wu Y√ºeh Ch'un Ch'iu:* \\\"The King of Wu summoned Sun Tz≈≠, and asked him\nquestions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a chapter of his\nwork, the King could not find words enough to praise him.\\\" As he points\nout, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the\nabove-mentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail\nto be considerable. Then the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun\nTz≈≠ might be included. The fact that the *Han Chih* mentions no work of\nSun Tz≈≠ except the 82 *p'ien*, whereas the Sui and T'ang bibliographies\ngive the titles of others in addition to the \\\"13 chapters,\\\" is good\nproof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82\n*p'ien*. Without pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied\nby the *Wu Y√ºeh Ch'un Ch'iu*, or admitting the genuineness of any of the\ntreatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in this theory a probable\nsolution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch'ien and Pan Ku there was\nplenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under\nthe magic name of Sun Tz≈≠, and the 82 *p'ien* may very well represent a\ncollected edition of these lumped together with the original work. It is\nalso possible, though less likely, that some of them existed in the time\nof the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him. \\[16\\]\n\nTu Mu's conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states: \\\"Wei Wu\nTi strung together Sun Wu's *Art of War*,\\\" which in turn may have\nresulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of Ts'ao King's\npreface. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out, is only a modest way of\nsaying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other words, wrote\na commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\nacceptance. Thus, the *Ssu K'u Ch'uan Shu* says: \\\"The mention of the 13\nchapters in the *Shih Chi* shows that they were in existence before the\n*Han Chih*, and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of\nthe original work. Tu Mu's assertion can certainly not be taken as\nproof.\\\"\n\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in\nthe time of Ssu-ma Ch'ien practically as we have them now. That the work\nwas then well known he tells us in so many words. \\\"Sun Tz≈≠'s *13\nChapters* and Wu Ch'i's *Art of War* are the two books that people\ncommonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of them are\nwidely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\\\" But as we go\nfurther back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact\nwhich has to be faced is that the *Tso Chuan*, the greatest contemporary\nrecord, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a general or as\na writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance, that many\nscholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in\nthe *Shih Chi*, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the\nexistence of the man at all. The most powerful presentment of this side\nof the case is to be found in the following disposition by Yeh\nShui-hsin: \\[17\\]---\\\n\\\n\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch'ien's history that Sun Wu was a native of the\nCh'i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he\ncrushed Ch'u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso's\nCommentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso's Commentary\nneed not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain. But\nTso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians\nsuch as Ying K'ao-shu, \\[18\\] Ts'ao Kuei, \\[19\\], Chu Chih-wu and Chuan\nShe-chu \\[20\\]. In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements were\nso brilliant, the omission is much more glaring. Again, details are\ngiven, in their due order, about his contemporaries Wu Yuan and the\nMinister P'ei. \\[21\\] Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been\npassed over?\n\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tz≈≠'s work belongs to the same school as\n*Kuan Tz≈≠*, \\[22\\] *Liu T'ao*, \\[23\\] and the *Y√ºeh Yu* \\[24\\] and may\nhave been the production of some private scholar living towards the end\nof the \\\"Spring and Autumn\\\" or the beginning of the \\\"Warring States\\\"\nperiod. \\[25\\] The story that his precepts were actually applied by the\nWu State, is merely the outcome of big talk on the part of his\nfollowers.\n\nFrom the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty \\[26\\] down to the time\nof the \\\"Spring and Autumn,\\\" all military commanders were statesmen as\nwell, and the class of professional generals, for conducting external\ncampaigns, did not then exist. It was not until the period of the \\\"Six\nStates\\\" \\[27\\] that this custom changed. Now although Wu was an\nuncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have left\nunrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no\ncivil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chu \\[28\\] and Sun\nWu, is not authentic matter, but the reckless fabrication of theorizing\npundits. The story of Ho Lu's experiment on the women, in particular, is\nutterly preposterous and incredible.\n\nYeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch'ien as having said that Sun Wu\ncrushed Ch'u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the\nimpression left on the reader's mind is that he at least shared in these\nexploits. The fact may or may not be significant; but it is nowhere\nexplicitly stated in the *Shih Chi* either that Sun Tz≈≠ was general on\nthe occasion of the taking of Ying, or that he even went there at all.\nMoreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P'ei both took part in the\nexpedition, and also that its success was largely due to the dash and\nenterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu's younger brother, it is not easy to see how\nyet another general could have played a very prominent part in the same\ncampaign.\n\nCh'en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:---\n\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the\nfact that he does not appear in the *Tso Chuan*, although he is said to\nhave served under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he\nreally belonged to.\n\nHe also says:---\n\nThe works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch'i may be of genuine antiquity.\n\nIt is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch'en Chen-sun, while\nrejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch'ien's\nhistory, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the\nwork which passes under his name. The author of the *Hsu Lu* fails to\nappreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on Ch'en\nChen-sun really misses its mark. He makes one of two points, however,\nwhich certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of our \\\"13\nchapters.\\\" \\\"Sun Tz≈≠,\\\" he says, \\\"must have lived in the age of Ching\nWang \\[519-476\\], because he is frequently plagiarized in subsequent\nworks of the Chou, Ch'in and Han dynasties.\\\" The two most shameless\noffenders in this respect are Wu Ch'i and Huai-nan Tz≈≠, both of them\nimportant historical personages in their day. The former lived only a\ncentury after the alleged date of Sun Tz≈≠, and his death is known to\nhave taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang,\nthat Tseng Shen delivered the *Tso Chuan*, which had been entrusted to\nhim by its author. \\[29\\] Now the fact that quotations from the *Art of\nWar*, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of\ndifferent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all,---in\nother words, that Sun Tz≈≠'s treatise was already in existence towards\nthe end of the 5th century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tz≈≠'s antiquity is\nfurnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a\nnumber of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be\nextended, is given in the *Hsu Lu;* and though some of the\ninterpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected\nthereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a scholar\nand critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing\nthat he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of\nSun Wu himself, we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to\nassign the work to a later date had he not honestly believed the\ncontrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an\neducated Chinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is not\nfar to seek. Thus in XIII. ¬ß 1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the\nancient system of land-tenure which had already passed away by the time\nof Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in a modified form. \\[30\\]\nThe only warfare Sun Tz≈≠ knows is that carried on between the various\nfeudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large part. Their use\nseems to have entirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty. He\nspeaks as a man of Wu, a state which ceased to exist as early as 473\nB.C. On this I shall touch presently.\n\nBut once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances\nof its being other than a *bon√¢ fide* production are sensibly\ndiminished. The great age of forgeries did not come until long after.\nThat it should have been forged in the period immediately following 473\nis particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\nhimself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin's theory, that the\nauthor was a literary recluse, that seems to me quite untenable. If one\nthing is more apparent than another after reading the maxims of Sun Tz≈≠,\nit is that their essence has been distilled from a large store of\npersonal observation and experience. They reflect the mind not only of a\nborn strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but also\nof a practical soldier closely acquainted with the military conditions\nof his time. To say nothing of the fact that these sayings have been\naccepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains of Chinese history,\nthey offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and\ncommon sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially\nconcocted in the study. If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the\ngenuine production of a military man living towards the end of the\n\\\"*Ch'un Ch'iu*\\\" period, are we not bound, in spite of the silence of\nthe *Tso Chuan*, to accept Ssu-ma Ch'ien's account in its entirety? In\nview of his high repute as a sober historian, must we not hesitate to\nassume that the records he drew upon for Sun Wu's biography were false\nand untrustworthy? The answer, I fear, must be in the negative. There is\nstill one grave, if not fatal, objection to the chronology involved in\nthe story as told in the *Shih Chi*, which, so far as I am aware, nobody\nhas yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tz≈≠ in which he\nalludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ¬ß 21:---\n\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Y√ºeh exceed our own in\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I\nsay then that victory can be achieved.\n\nThe other is in XI. ¬ß 30:---\n\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the *shuai-jan*, I should\nanswer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Y√ºeh are enemies; yet if\nthey are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm,\nthey will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps\nthe right.\n\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of\ncomposition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle between\nWu and Y√ºeh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has\nhitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the\ncredibility of Ssu-ma Ch'ien's narrative. As we have seen above, the\nfirst positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is\nthen spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so\nthat his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place,\nand of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier still. But\nat that time, and for several years after, down to the capture of Ying\nin 506, Ch'u and not Y√ºeh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two\nstates, Ch'u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century,\n\\[31\\] whereas the first war between Wu and Y√ºeh was waged only in 510,\n\\[32\\] and even then was no more than a short interlude sandwiched in\nthe midst of the fierce struggle with Ch'u. Now Ch'u is not mentioned in\nthe 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were written\nat a time when Y√ºeh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is,\nafter Ch'u had suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a\ntable of dates may be found useful.\\\n\\\n\n  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\n  B.C.                                \n\n  514                                 Accession of Ho Lu.\n\n  512                                 Ho Lu attacks Ch'u, but is\n                                      dissuaded from entering Ying,\\\n                                      the capital. *Shih Chi* mentions\n                                      Sun Wu as general.\n\n  511                                 Another attack on Ch'u.\n\n  510                                 Wu makes a successful attack on\n                                      Y√ºeh.

It seems rather to\nimply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and\nthat she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude\nthat our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Y√ºeh\ndoes not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu\ndied in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been\nduring the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu\nhaving presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch'u. On the\nother hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting Sun Wu's\nname with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the light between 496\nand 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Y√ºeh was once again\nbecoming a very serious menace. \\[33\\] We may feel fairly certain that\nthe author, whoever he may have been, was not a man of any great\neminence in his own day. On this point the negative testimony of the\n*Tso Chuan* far outweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the\n*Shih Chi*, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun Hsing-yen,\nhowever, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\nthe great commentary. It was Wu Tz≈≠-hsu, he says, who got all the credit\nof Sun Wu's exploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not\nrewarded with an office in the State.\n\nHow then did the Sun Tz≈≠ legend originate? It may be that the growing\ncelebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to\nits author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well\nversed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his\ncredit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest\nfeat of arms in Ho Lu's reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on\nall the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of\nher power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the\nacknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified\nwith that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain\nconceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out\nby him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, \\[34\\] Po P'ei and Fu Kai?\n\nIt is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun\nTz≈≠'s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this\nnecessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of\nWu about the time of Ho Lu's accession, and gathered experience, though\nonly in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense\nmilitary activity which marked the first half of the prince's reign.\n\\[35\\] If he rose to be a general at all, he certainly was never on an\nequal footing with the three above mentioned. He was doubtless present\nat the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu's sudden\ncollapse in the following year. Y√ºeh's attack at this critical juncture,\nwhen her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced\nhim that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against whom every\neffort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus a\nwell-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book, which\naccording to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end, rather\nthan the beginning of Ho Lu's reign. The story of the women may possibly\nhave grown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As\nwe hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly\nlikely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the\ndeath-struggle with Y√ºeh, which began with the disaster at Tsui-li.\n\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony\nin the fate which decreed that China's most illustrious man of peace\nshould be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap04}The Text of Sun Tz≈≠\n\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tz≈≠'s\ntext. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the\n\\\"13 chapters\\\" of which Ssu-ma Ch'ien speaks were essentially the same\nas those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely\ncirculated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:---\n\nDuring the Ch'in and Han dynasties Sun Tz≈≠'s *Art of War* was in general\nuse amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a\nwork of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the\nbenefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to\nwrite a commentary on it.\n\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that\nTs'ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so\nobscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time onward\nso great, especially during the T'ang and Sung dynasties, that it would\nbe surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep in.\nTowards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief\ncommentaries on Sun Tz≈≠ were in existence, a certain Chi T'ien-pao\npublished a work in 15 *chuan* entitled \\\"Sun Tz≈≠ with the collected\ncommentaries of ten writers.\\\" There was another text, with variant\nreadings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters\namong the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun\nHsing-yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no\nlonger put into circulation. Thus, until the end of the 18th century,\nthe text in sole possession of the field was one derived from Chi\nT'ien-pao's edition, although no actual copy of that important work was\nknown to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tz≈≠ which\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in\n1726, the *Ku Chin T'u Shu Chi Ch'eng*. Another copy at my disposal of\nwhat is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that\ncontained in the \\\"Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch'in dynasties\\\"\n\\[1758\\]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop's first edition is\nevidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese\nchannels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen \\[1752-1818\\], a\ndistinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an\nactual descendant of Sun Wu, \\[36\\] accidentally discovered a copy of\nChi T'ien-pao's long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the\nHua-yin temple. \\[37\\] Appended to it was the *I Shuo* of Cheng\nYu-Hsien, mentioned in the *T'ung Chih*, and also believed to have\nperished. This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the \\\"original\nedition (or text)\\\"---a rather misleading name, for it cannot by any\nmeans claim to set before us the text of Sun Tz≈≠ in its pristine purity.\nChi T'ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content\nto reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day, without\ntroubling to collate it with the earliest editions then available.\nFortunately, two versions of Sun Tz≈≠, even older than the newly\ndiscovered work, were still extant, one buried in the *T'ung Tien*, Tu\nYu's great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined\nin the *T'ai P'ing Yu Lan* encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to\nbe found, though split up into fragments, intermixed with other matter,\nand scattered piecemeal over a number of different sections. Considering\nthat the *Yu Lan* takes us back to the year 983, and the *T'ung Tien*\nabout 200 years further still, to the middle of the T'ang dynasty, the\nvalue of these early transcripts of Sun Tz≈≠ can hardly be overestimated.\nYet the idea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone\nuntil Sun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a\nthorough recension of the text. This is his own account:---\n\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tz≈≠ which his\neditors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition\n\\[of Chi T'ien-pao\\] should be used, and that the text should be revised\nand corrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi\nKua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted\nthemselves to this study, probably surpassing me therein. Accordingly, I\nhave had the whole work cut on blocks as a textbook for military men.\n\nThe three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on\nthe text of Sun Tz≈≠ prior to Sun Hsing-yen's commission, but we are left\nin doubt as to the work they really accomplished. At any rate, the new\nedition, when ultimately produced, appeared in the names of Sun\nHsing-yen and only one co-editor Wu Jen-shi. They took the \\\"original\nedition\\\" as their basis, and by careful comparison with older versions,\nas well as the extant commentaries and other sources of information such\nas the *I Shuo*, succeeded in restoring a very large number of doubtful\npassages, and turned out, on the whole, what must be accepted as the\nclosest approximation we are ever likely to get to Sun Tz≈≠'s original\nwork. This is what will hereafter be denominated the \\\"standard text.\\\"\n\nThe copy which I have used belongs to a reissue dated 1877. It is in 6\n*pen*, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical\nworks in 83 *pen*. \\[38\\] It opens with a preface by Sun Hsing-yen\n(largely quoted in this introduction), vindicating the traditional view\nof Sun Tz≈≠'s life and performances, and summing up in remarkably concise\nfashion the evidence in its favour. This is followed by Ts'ao Kung's\npreface to his edition, and the biography of Sun Tz≈≠ from the *Shih\nChi*, both translated above. Then come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien's *I\nShuo*, \\[39\\] with author's preface, and next, a short miscellany of\nhistorical and bibliographical information entitled *Sun Tz≈≠ Hsu Lu*,\ncompiled by Pi I-hsun. As regards the body of the work, each separate\nsentence is followed by a note on the text, if required, and then by the\nvarious commentaries appertaining to it, arranged in chronological\norder. These we shall now proceed to discuss briefly, one by one.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap05}The Commentators\n\nSun Tz≈≠ can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of\ncommentators, which would do honour to any classic. Ou-yang Hsiu remarks\non this fact, though he wrote before the tale was complete, and rather\ningeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of war, being\ninexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a great\nvariety of ways.\n\n1\\. TS'AO TS'AO or Ts'ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti \\[A.D.\n155-220\\]. There is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest\ncommentary on Sun Tz≈≠ actually came from the pen of this extraordinary\nman, whose biography in the *San Kuo Chih* reads like a romance. One of\nthe greatest military geniuses that the world has seen, and Napoleonic\nin the scale of his operations, he was especially famed for the\nmarvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found expression in the\nline \\\"Talk of Ts'ao Ts'ao, and Ts'ao Ts'ao will appear.\\\" Ou-yang Hsiu\nsays of him that he was a great captain who \\\"measured his strength\nagainst Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and vanquished\nthem all; whereupon he divided the Empire of Han with Wu and Shu, and\nmade himself king. It is recorded that whenever a council of war was\nheld by Wei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign, he had all his\ncalculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not lose one\nbattle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their\narmies incontinently beaten and put to flight.\\\" Ts'ao Kung's notes on\nSun Tz≈≠, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly characteristic of\nthe stern commander known to history, that it is hard indeed to conceive\nof them as the work of a mere *litt√©rateur*. Sometimes, indeed, owing to\nextreme compression, they are scarcely intelligible and stand no less in\nneed of a commentary than the text itself. \\[40\\]\n\n2\\. MENG SHIH. The commentary which has come down to us under this name\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his\npersonal name has not been recorded. Chi T'ien-pao's edition places him\nafter Chia Lin, and Ch'ao Kung-wu also assigns him to the T'ang dynasty,\n\\[41\\] but this is a mistake. In Sun Hsing-yen's preface, he appears as\nMeng Shih of the Liang dynasty \\[502-557\\]. Others would identify him\nwith Meng K'ang of the 3rd century. He is named in one work as the last\nof the \\\"Five Commentators,\\\" the others being Wei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch'en\nHao and Chia Lin.\n\n3\\. LI CH'UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military\ntactics. One of his works has been in constant use down to the present\nday. The *T'ung Chih* mentions \\\"Lives of famous generals from the Chou\nto the T'ang dynasty\\\" as written by him. \\[42\\] According to Ch'ao\nKung-wu and the *T'ien-i-ko* catalogue, he followed a variant of the\ntext of Sun Tz≈≠ which differs considerably from those now extant. His\nnotes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently illustrates\nhis remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\n\n4\\. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tz≈≠,\nhis notes being taken from the *T'ung Tien*, the encyclopedic treatise\non the Constitution which was his life-work. They are largely\nrepetitions of Ts'ao Kung and Meng Shih, besides which it is believed\nthat he drew on the ancient commentaries of Wang Ling and others. Owing\nto the peculiar arrangement of *T'ung Tien*, he has to explain each\npassage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes his own\nexplanation does not agree with that of Ts'ao Kung, whom he always\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \\\"Ten\nCommentators,\\\" he was added to their number by Chi T'ien-pao, being\nwrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu.\n\n5\\. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet---a bright star\neven in the glorious galaxy of the T'ang period. We learn from Ch'ao\nKung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was\nextremely fond of discussing the subject, and was moreover well read in\nthe military history of the *Ch'un Ch'iu* and *Chan Kuo* eras. His\nnotes, therefore, are well worth attention. They are very copious, and\nreplete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tz≈≠'s work is thus\nsummarized by him: \\\"Practice benevolence and justice, but on the other\nhand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.\\\" He further\ndeclared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand\nyears which had elapsed since Sun Tz≈≠'s death would, upon examination,\nbe found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims\ncontained in his book. Tu Mu's somewhat spiteful charge against Ts'ao\nKung has already been considered elsewhere.\n\n6\\. CH'EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch'ao\nKung-wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tz≈≠\nbecause Ts'ao Kung's on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and\nthat of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu,\nwriting in the middle of the 11th century, calls Ts'ao Kung, Tu Mu and\nCh'en Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tz≈≠, and observes that\nCh'en Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu's shortcomings. His commentary,\nthough not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his predecessors.\n\n7\\. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T'ang dynasty, for his\ncommentary on Sun Tz≈≠ is mentioned in the *T'ang Shu* and was afterwards\nrepublished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with those of Meng\nShih and Tu Yu. It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in point of\nquality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven.\n\n8\\. MEI YAO-CH'EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his \\\"style\\\" as Mei\nSheng-yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was\npublished with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which\nwe may cull the following:---\n\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tz≈≠, distorting his words and trying to\nmake them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though\ncommentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the\ntask. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen into this mistake. In attempting\nto provide a critical commentary for Sun Tz≈≠'s work, he does not lose\nsight of the fact that these sayings were intended for states engaged in\ninternecine warfare; that the author is not concerned with the military\nconditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient\ndynasties, \\[43\\] nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the\nMinister of War. \\[44\\] Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his\nmeaning is always deep. Whether the subject be marching an army, or\nhandling soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the forces of\nvictory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are bound\ntogether in strict logical sequence, though this has been obscured by\ncommentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning. In his own\ncommentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the obstinate prejudices\nof these critics, and has tried to bring out the true meaning of Sun Tz≈≠\nhimself. In this way, the clouds of confusion have been dispersed and\nthe sayings made clear. I am convinced that the present work deserves to\nbe handed down side by side with the three great commentaries; and for a\ngreat deal that they find in the sayings, coming generations will have\nconstant reason to thank my friend Sheng-yu.\n\nMaking some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined to\nendorse this favourable judgment, and would certainly place him above\nCh'en Hao in order of merit.\n\n9\\. WANG HSI, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original in some of\nhis interpretations, but much less judicious than Mei Yao-ch'en, and on\nthe whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond of comparing his own\ncommentary with that of Ts'ao Kung, but the comparison is not often\nflattering to him. We learn from Ch'ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised the\nancient text of Sun Tz≈≠, filling up lacunae and correcting mistakes.\n\\[45\\]\n\n10\\. HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this\ncommentator is given as above by Cheng Ch'iao in the *Tung Chih*,\nwritten about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply\nas Ho Shih in the *Yu Hai*, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch'ao Kung-wu as\nsaying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no reason to\ndoubt Cheng Ch'iao's statement, otherwise I should have been inclined to\nhazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch'u-fei, the author of a\nshort treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th century.\nHo Shih's commentary, in the words of the *T'ien-i-ko* catalogue,\n\\\"contains helpful additions\\\" here and there, but is chiefly remarkable\nfor the copious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic\nhistories and other sources.\n\n11\\. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great\noriginality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid\nexposition. His commentator is based on that of Ts'ao Kung, whose terse\nsentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion.\nWithout Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts'ao Kung's commentary\nwould have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and therefore\nvalueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the *T'ung\nK'ao*, or the *Yu Hai*, but it finds a niche in the *T'ung Chih*, which\nalso names him as the author of the \\\"Lives of Famous Generals.\\\" \\[46\\]\n\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have\nflourished within so short a space of time. Ch'ao Kung-wu accounts for\nit by saying: \\\"During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire\nenjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of\nwar. but when \\[Chao\\] Yuan-hao's rebellion came \\[1038-42\\] and the\nfrontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made\nstrenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the\nvogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the commentators\nof Sun Tz≈≠ in our dynasty belong mainly to that period. \\[47\\]\n\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work\nhas not come down to us. The *Sui Shu* mentions four, namely Wang Ling\n(often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tz≈≠); Chang Tz≈≠-shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;\n\\[48\\] and Shen Yu of Wu. The *T'ang Shu* adds Sun Hao, and the *T'ung\nChih* Hsiao Chi, while the *T'u Shu* mentions a Ming commentator, Huang\nJun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely\ncollectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T'ien-pao and Chi\nHsieh, mentioned above.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap06}Appreciations of Sun Tz≈≠\n\nSun Tz≈≠ has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of\nChina's greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have\nstudied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (*d*. 196\nB.C.), \\[49\\] Feng I (*d*. 34 A.D.), \\[50\\] Lu Meng (*d*. 219), \\[51\\]\nand Yo Fei (1103-1141). \\[52\\] The opinion of Ts'ao Kung, who disputes\nwith Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already\nbeen recorded. \\[53\\] Still more remarkable, in one way, is the\ntestimony of purely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su\nTung-p'o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe\ntheir chief inspiration to Sun Tz≈≠. The following short passage by him\nis preserved in the *Yu Hai:* \\[54\\]---\n\nSun Wu's saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,\n\\[55\\] is very different indeed from what other books tell us. \\[56\\] Wu\nCh'i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on\nwar, and they are linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\"\nBut Wu Ch'i's remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and\nmore crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun\nTz≈≠'s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\n\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden\nof Literature\\\" by Cheng Hou:---\n\nSun Tz≈≠'s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military\nmen's training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars\nand men of letters. His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet\nprofound, perspicuous and eminently practical. Such works as the *Lun\nYu*, the *I Ching* and the great Commentary, \\[57\\] as well as the\nwritings of Mencius, Hsun K'uang and Yang Chu, all fall below the level\nof Sun Tz≈≠.\n\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the\ncriticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the\nvenerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, \\\"encourages\na ruler's bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism.\\\"\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap07}Apologies for War\n\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving\nnation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her experience\nof war in all its phases has also been such as no modern State can\nparallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point at which they\nare lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall and was\nmaintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the\nfirst Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual\ncollisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns,\nTurks and other invaders after the centralization of government, the\nterrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of so many dynasties,\nbesides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have flamed\nup and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that\nthe clash of arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another\nof the Empire.\n\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom\nChina can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond\nof emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch'i\nstands out conspicuous in the period when Ch'in was entering upon her\nfinal struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years\nwhich followed the break-up of the Ch'in dynasty are illuminated by the\ntranscendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is\ntottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts'ao Ts'ao\ndominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T'ang dynasty, one\nof the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li\nShih-min (afterwards the Emperor T'ai Tsung) was seconded by the\nbrilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear\ncomparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.\n\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tz≈≠\ndownwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature of\nConfucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to\nmilitarism in any form. It is such an uncommon thing to find any of the\nliterati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it worth\nwhile to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox\nview is upheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch'ien, shows that for all his\nardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any\nprice:---\n\nMilitary weapons are the means used by the Sage to punish violence and\ncruelty, to give peace to troublous times, to remove difficulties and\ndangers, and to succour those who are in peril. Every animal with blood\nin its veins and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How\nmuch more so will man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love\nand hatred, joy and anger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection\nsprings up within him; when angry, his poisoned sting is brought into\nplay. That is the natural law which governs his being.... What then\nshall be said of those scholars of our time, blind to all great issues,\nand without any appreciation of relative values, who can only bark out\ntheir stale formulas about \\\"virtue\\\" and \\\"civilization,\\\" condemning\nthe use of military weapons? They will surely bring our country to\nimpotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage; or, at\nthe very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion, sacrifice\nof territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse to\nmodify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in\nthe family the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be\ndispensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be\nallowed to fall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that\nthis power will be exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and\nthat among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.\n\\[58\\]\n\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu's preface to his commentary on Sun\nTz≈≠:---\\\n\\\n\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of\ngovernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch'iu, both\ndisciples of Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of\nlitigation, the imprisonment of offenders and their execution by\nflogging in the market-place, are all done by officials. But the\nwielding of huge armies, the throwing down of fortified cities, the\nhauling of women and children into captivity, and the beheading of\ntraitors---this is also work which is done by officials. The objects of\nthe rack and of military weapons are essentially the same. There is no\nintrinsic difference between the punishment of flogging and cutting off\nheads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which are easily dealt\nwith, only a small amount of force need be employed: hence the use of\nmilitary weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both cases, however, the\nend in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give comfort and\nrelief to the good....\n\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \\\"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\\\" Jan Yu replied: \\\"It has been\nacquired by study.\\\" \\[59\\] \\\"How can that be so,\\\" said Chi-sun,\n\\\"seeing that you are a disciple of Confucius?\\\" \\\"It is a fact,\\\"\nreplied Jan Yu; \\\"I was taught by Confucius. It is fitting that the\ngreat Sage should exercise both civil and military functions, though to\nbe sure my instruction in the art of fighting has not yet gone very\nfar.\\\"\n\nNow, who the author was of this rigid distinction between the \\\"civil\\\"\nand the \\\"military,\\\" and the limitation of each to a separate sphere of\naction, or in what year of which dynasty it was first introduced, is\nmore than I can say. But, at any rate, it has come about that the\nmembers of the governing class are quite afraid of enlarging on military\ntopics, or do so only in a shamefaced manner. If any are bold enough to\ndiscuss the subject, they are at once set down as eccentric individuals\nof coarse and brutal propensities. This is an extraordinary instance in\nwhich, through sheer lack of reasoning, men unhappily lose sight of\nfundamental principles.\n\nWhen the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch'eng Wang, he regulated\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted, \\[60\\] he\nsallied forth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the\nDuke of Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku, \\[61\\] he said: \\\"If\npacific negotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have\nbeen made beforehand.\\\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch'i, who\ncowered under him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said\nthat these two great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\n\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tz≈≠ in high esteem. He also\nappeals to the authority of the Classics:---\n\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \\\"I have never\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\\\" \\[62\\] Replying\nto K'ung Wen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats\nand weapons.\\\" But if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he\nused armed force against the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch'i was\noverawed. Again, when the inhabitants of Pi revolted; he ordered his\nofficers to attack them, whereupon they were defeated and fled in\nconfusion. He once uttered the words: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\" \\[63\\]\nAnd Jan Yu also said: \\\"The Sage exercises both civil and military\nfunctions.\\\" \\[64\\] Can it be a fact that Confucius never studied or\nreceived instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he did not\nspecially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be the\nsubject of his teaching.\n\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tz≈≠, writes in similar strain:---\\\n\\\n\nConfucius said: \\\"I am unversed in military matters.\\\" \\[65\\] He also\nsaid: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and\nregulated music. Now war constitutes one of the five classes of State\nceremonial, \\[66\\] and must not be treated as an independent branch of\nstudy. Hence, the words \\\"I am unversed in\\\" must be taken to mean that\nthere are things which even an inspired Teacher does not know. Those who\nhave to lead an army and devise stratagems, must learn the art of war.\nBut if one can command the services of a good general like Sun Tz≈≠, who\nwas employed by Wu Tz≈≠-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence\nthe remark added by Confucius: \\\"If I fight, I conquer.\\\"\n\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on the\nart of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they adduce\nthe example of Chao Kua, who pored over his father's books to no\npurpose, \\[67\\] as a proof that all military theory is useless. Again,\nseeing that books on war have to do with such things as opportunism in\ndesigning plans, and the conversion of spies, they hold that the art is\nimmoral and unworthy of a sage. These people ignore the fact that the\nstudies of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials\nalso require steady application and practice before efficiency is\nreached. The ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices\nto botch their work. \\[68\\] Weapons are baneful \\[69\\] and fighting\nperilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice, he ought\nnot to hazard other men's lives in battle. \\[70\\] Hence it is essential\nthat Sun Tz≈≠'s 13 chapters should be studied.\n\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi \\[71\\] in the art of war.\nChi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not\npursue his studies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that\nhe was finally defeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the\ntricks and artifices of war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang\nof Sung and King Yen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their\nmisplaced humanity. The treacherous and underhand nature of war\nnecessitates the use of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion.\nThere is a case on record of Confucius himself having violated an\nextorted oath, \\[72\\] and also of his having left the Sung State in\ndisguise. \\[73\\] Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tz≈≠ for disregarding\ntruth and honesty?\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap08}Bibliography\n\nThe following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tz≈≠.\nThe notes on each have been drawn principally from the *Ssu k'u ch'uan\nshu chien ming mu lu*, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq.\n\n1\\. *Wu Tz≈≠*, in 1 *chuan* or 6 chapters. By Wu Ch'i (*d*. 381 B.C.). A\ngenuine work. See *Shih Chi*, ch. 65.\n\n2\\. *Ssu-ma Fa*, in 1 *chuan* or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to\nSsu-ma Jang-chu of the 6th century B.C. Its date, however, must be\nearly, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly to\nbe met within its pages. See *Shih Chi*, ch. 64.\n\nThe *Ssu K'u Ch'uan Shu* (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three\ntreatises on war, *Sun Tz≈≠*, *Wu Tz≈≠* and *Ssu-ma Fa*, are, generally\nspeaking, only concerned with things strictly military---the art of\nproducing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the correct\ntheory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans, transport of\ngoods and the handling of soldiers---in strong contrast to later works,\nin which the science of war is usually blended with metaphysics,\ndivination and magical arts in general.\n\n3\\. *Liu T'ao*, in 6 *chuan*, or 60 chapters. Attributed to Lu Wang (or\nLu Shang, also known as T'ai Kung) of the 12th century B.C. \\[74\\] But\nits style does not belong to the era of the Three Dynasties. Lu Te-ming\n(550-625 A.D.) mentions the work, and enumerates the headings of the six\nsections so that the forgery cannot have been later than Sui dynasty.\n\n4\\. *Wei Liao Tz≈≠*, in 5 *chuan*. Attributed to Wei Liao (4th cent.\nB.C.), who studied under the famous Kuei-ku Tz≈≠. The work appears to\nhave been originally in 31 chapters, whereas the text we possess\ncontains only 24. Its matter is sound enough in the main, though the\nstrategical devices differ considerably from those of the Warring States\nperiod. It is been furnished with a commentary by the well-known Sung\nphilosopher Chang Tsai.\n\n5\\. *San Lueh* in 3 *chuan*. Attributed to Huang-shih Kung, a legendary\npersonage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang (*d*. 187 B.C.)\nin an interview on a bridge. But here again, the style is not that of\nworks dating from the Ch'in or Han period. The Han Emperor Kuang Wu\n\\[25-57 A.D.\\] apparently quotes from it in one of his proclamations;\nbut the passage in question may have been inserted later on, in order to\nprove the genuineness of the work. We shall not be far out if we refer\nit to the Northern Sung period \\[420-478 A.D.\\], or somewhat earlier.\n\n6\\. *Li Wei Kung Wen Tui*, in 3 sections. Written in the form of a\ndialogue between T'ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching, it is\nusually ascribed to the latter. Competent authorities consider it a\nforgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of war.\n\n7\\. *Li Ching Ping Fa* (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is a\nshort treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the T'ung Tien, but not\npublished separately. This fact explains its omission from the *Ssu K'u\nCh'uan Shu*.\n\n8\\. *Wu Ch'i Ching*, in 1 *chuan*. Attributed to the legendary minister\nFeng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty\n(*d*. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the celebrated\ngeneral Ma Lung (*d*. 300 A.D.). Yet the earliest mention of it is in\nthe *Sung Chih*. Although a forgery, the work is well put together.\n\nConsidering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko Liang has always\nbeen held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on war\nascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the *Shih Liu Ts'e* (1 *chuan*),\npreserved in the *Yung Lo Ta Tien;* (2) *Chiang Yuan* (1 *chuan*); and\n(3) *Hsin Shu* (1 *chuan*), which steals wholesale from Sun Tz≈≠. None of\nthese has the slightest claim to be considered genuine.\n\nMost of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections\ndevoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found\nuseful:---\n\n*T'ung Tien* (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162.\\\n*T'ai P'ing Yu Lan* (983), ch. 270-359.\\\n*Wen Hsien Tung K'ao* (13th cent.), ch. 221.\\\n*Yu Hai* (13th cent.), ch. 140, 141.\\\n*San Ts'ai T'u Hui* (16th cent).\\\n*Kuang Po Wu Chih* (1607), ch. 31, 32.\\\n*Ch'ien Ch'io Lei Shu* (1632), ch. 75.\\\n*Yuan Chien Lei Han* (1710), ch. 206-229.\\\n*Ku Chin T'u Shu Chi Ch'eng* (1726), section XXX, esp. ch. 81-90.\\\n*Hsu Wen Hsien T'ung K'ao* (1784), ch. 121-134.\\\n*Huang Ch'ao Ching Shih Wen Pien* (1826), ch. 76, 77.\\\n\nThe bibliographical sections of certain historical works also deserve\nmention:---\n\n*Ch'ien Han Shu*, ch. 30.\\\n*Sui Shu*, ch. 32-35.\\\n*Chiu T'ang Shu*, ch. 46, 47.\\\n*Hsin T'ang Shu*, ch. 57,60.\\\n*Sung Shih*, ch. 202-209.\\\n*T'ung Chih* (circa 1150), ch. 68.\\\n\nTo these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the Imperial\nLibrary:---\n\n*Ssu K'u Ch'uan Shu Tsung Mu T'i Yao* (1790), ch. 99, 100.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1\\. *Shih Chi*, ch. 65.\n\n2\\.

Ssu-ma Jang-chu, whose family name was T'ien, lived in the latter\nhalf of the 6th century B.C., and is also believed to have written a\nwork on war. See *Shih Chi*, ch. 64, and infra at the beginning of the\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n29\\. See Legge's Classics, vol. V, Prolegomena p. 27.

When Wu first appears in the *Ch'un Ch'iu* in 584, it is already at\nvariance with its powerful neighbour. The *Ch'un Ch'iu* first mentions\nY√ºeh in 537, the *Tso Chuan* in 601.\n\n32\\. This is explicitly stated in the *Tso Chuan*, XXXII, 2.\n\n33\\. There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would\ntend to grow more bitter after each encounter, and thus more fully\njustify the language used in XI. ¬ß 30.\n\n34\\. With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse:---a spurious\ntreatise on war has been fathered on him simply because he was a great\ngeneral. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the\nother hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century.\n\n35\\.

LAYING PLANS\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of\nthis chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple selected\nby the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent.\nSee. ¬ß 26.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\n\n2\\. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to\nruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be\nneglected.\n\n3\\. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be\ntaken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the\nconditions obtaining in the field.\n\n4\\. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The\nCommander; (5) Method and discipline.\n\n\\[It appears from what follows that Sun Tz≈≠ means by \\\"Moral Law\\\" a\nprinciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tz≈≠ in its moral aspect.\nOne might be tempted to render it by \\\"morale,\\\" were it not considered\nas an attribute of the *ruler* in ¬ß 13.\\]\n\n5, 6. *The Moral Law* causes the people to be in complete accord with\ntheir ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,\nundismayed by any danger.\n\n\\[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz≈≠ as saying: \\\"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\\\"\\]\n\n7\\. *Heaven* signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\n\n\\[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words\nhere. Meng Shih refers to \\\"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\\\"\nof Heaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant\nis \\\"the general economy of Heaven,\\\" including the five elements, the\nfour seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.\\]\n\n8\\. *Earth* comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;\nopen ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\n\n9\\. *The Commander* stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,\nbenevolence, courage and strictness.\n\n\\[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or\nbenevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control, or\n\\\"proper feeling;\\\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here\n\\\"wisdom\\\" and \\\"sincerity\\\" are put before \\\"humanity or benevolence,\\\"\nand the two military virtues of \\\"courage\\\" and \\\"strictness\\\"\nsubstituted for \\\"uprightness of mind\\\" and \\\"self-respect,\nself-control, or 'proper feeling.'\\\"\\]\n\n10\\. By *Method and discipline* are to be understood the marshalling of\nthe army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the\nofficers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army,\nand the control of military expenditure.\n\n11\\. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows\nthem will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.\n\n12\\. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the\nmilitary conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this\nwise:---\n\n13\\. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?\\\n\n\\[I.e., \\\"is in harmony with his subjects.\\\" Cf. ¬ß 5.\\]\\\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\\\n¬†¬†¬†¬†(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?\n\n\\[See ¬ß¬ß 7, 8\\]\n\n\\(4\\) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n\n\\[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts'ao Ts'ao (A.D. 155-220),\nwho was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his\nown severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned\nhimself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of\ncorn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy\nhis sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts'ao Ts'ao's own comment\non the present passage is characteristically curt: \\\"when you lay down a\nlaw, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must\nbe put to death.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(5\\) Which army is the stronger?\n\n\\[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch'en puts it, freely\nrendered, \\\"*esprit de corps* and 'big battalions.'\\\"\\]\n\n\\(6\\) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\n\n\\[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz≈≠ as saying: \\\"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(7\\) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and\npunishment?\n\n\\[On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be\nproperly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?\\]\n\n14\\. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or\ndefeat.\n\n15\\. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will\nconquer:---let such a one be retained in command! The general that\nhearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:---let\nsuch a one be dismissed!\n\n\\[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tz≈≠'s treatise was\ncomposed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu\nState.\\]\n\n16\\. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any\nhelpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.\n\n17\\. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one's\nplans.\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \\\"bookish\ntheoric.\\\" He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract\nprinciples; \\\"for,\\\" as Chang Yu puts it, \\\"while the main laws of\nstrategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry,\nyou must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to secure a\nfavourable position in actual warfare.\\\" On the eve of the battle of\nWaterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the Duke of\nWellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations were for\nthe morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find himself\nCommander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a critical\nmoment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \\\"Who will attack the\nfirst tomorrow---I or Bonaparte?\\\" \\\"Bonaparte,\\\" replied Lord Uxbridge.\n\\\"Well,\\\" continued the Duke, \\\"Bonaparte has not given me any idea of\nhis projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you expect\nme to tell you what mine are?\\\" \\[1\\] \\]\n\n18\\. All warfare is based on deception.\n\n\\[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every\nsoldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many\nmilitary qualities, was especially distinguished by \\\"the extraordinary\nskill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend and\nfoe.\\\"\\]\n\n19\\. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our\nforces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy\nbelieve we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are\nnear.\n\n20\\. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\n\n\\[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, \\\"When he is in disorder,\ncrush him.\\\" It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tz≈≠ is still\nillustrating the uses of deception in war.\\]\n\n21\\. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in\nsuperior strength, evade him.\n\n22\\. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.\nPretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n\n\\[Wang Tz≈≠, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his\nadversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and\nimmobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.\\]\n\n23\\. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\n\n\\[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch'en has the note:\n\\\"while we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself\nout.\\\" The *Yu Lan* has \\\"Lure him on and tire him out.\\\"\\]\n\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\n\n\\[Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the\ncommentators: \\\"If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division\nbetween them.\\\"\\]\n\n24\\. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not\nexpected.\n\n25\\. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged\nbeforehand.\n\n26\\. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his\ntemple ere the battle is fought.\n\n\\[Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple\nto be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the\nfield, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.\\]\n\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.\nThus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to\ndefeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this\npoint that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Words on Wellington,\\\" by Sir. W. Fraser.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap10}Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung has the note: \\\"He who wishes to fight must first count the\ncost,\\\" which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the\nchapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a\nconsideration of ways and means.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field\na thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred\nthousand mail-clad soldiers,\n\n\\[The \\\"swift chariots\\\" were lightly built and, according to Chang Yu,\nused for the attack; the \\\"heavy chariots\\\" were heavier, and designed\nfor purposes of defence. Li Ch'uan, it is true, says that the latter\nwere light, but this seems hardly probable. It is interesting to note\nthe analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric\nGreeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming\nas it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of\nfoot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed\nthat each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy\nchariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would be divided up into a\nthousand battalions, each consisting of two chariots and a hundred\nmen.\\]\n\nwith provisions enough to carry them a thousand *li*,\n\n\\[2.78 modern *li* go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly\nsince Sun Tz≈≠'s time.\\]\n\nthe expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of\nguests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots\nand armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day.\nSuch is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.\n\n2\\. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming,\nthe men's weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If you\nlay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\n\n3\\. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State\nwill not be equal to the strain.\n\n4\\. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength\nexhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to\ntake advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be\nable to avert the consequences that must ensue.\n\n5\\. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has\nnever been seen associated with long delays.\n\n\\[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of\nthe commentators. Ts'ao Kung, Li Ch'uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and Mei\nYao-ch'en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\nShih says: \\\"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure\nof energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but\nthey bring calamity in their train.\\\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by\nremarking: \\\"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being\nexpended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true\ncleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\\\" Chang Yu\nsays: \\\"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable\nto clever dilatoriness.\\\" Now Sun Tz≈≠ says nothing whatever, except\npossibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than\ningenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much\nmore guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,\ntardiness can never be anything but foolish---if only because it means\nimpoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by\nSun Tz≈≠, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur\nto the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome\nagainst that of Hannibals's isolated army, because it seemed to him that\nthe latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a strange\ncountry. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics would have\nproved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is true, led to\nCannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption in their\nfavour.\\]\n\n6\\. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged\nwarfare.\n\n7\\. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war\nthat can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\n\n\\[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a\nlong war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it\nto a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this interpretation,\nbut it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering,\n\\\"He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its\nbenefits,\\\" is distinctly pointless.\\]\n\n8\\. The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his\nsupply-waggons loaded more than twice.\n\n\\[Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for\nreinforcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies, but\ncrosses the enemy's frontier without delay. This may seem an audacious\npolicy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from Julius Caesar\nto Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time---that is, being a little ahead\nof your opponent---has counted for more than either numerical\nsuperiority or the nicest calculations with regard to commissariat.\\]\n\n9\\. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus\nthe army will have food enough for its needs.\n\n\\[The Chinese word translated here as \\\"war material\\\" literally means\n\\\"things to be used\\\", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all\nthe impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.\\]\n\n10\\. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by\ncontributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a\ndistance causes the people to be impoverished.\n\n\\[The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the\nnext, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is\nso awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text. It\nnever seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may be\nnecessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The Chinese\nwords Sun Tz≈≠ used to indicate the cause of the people's impoverishment\nclearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their\ncontributions of corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them\nto maintain an army in this way, except because the State or Government\nis too poor to do so?\\]\n\n11\\. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;\nand high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.\n\n\\[Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own\nterritory. Ts'ao Kung understands it of an army that has already crossed\nthe frontier.\\]\n\n12\\. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be\nafflicted by heavy exactions.\n\n13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the\nhomes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their\nincomes will be dissipated;\n\n\\[Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10,\nbut of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from\nour text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: \\\"The *people* being\nregarded as the essential part of the State, and *food* as the people's\nheaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be\ncareful of both?\\\"\\]\n\nwhile Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,\nbreast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,\nprotective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to\nfour-tenths of its total revenue.\n\n15\\. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One\ncartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own,\nand likewise a single *picul* of his provender is equivalent to twenty\nfrom one's own store.\n\n\\[Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of\ntransporting one cartload to the front. A *picul* is a unit of measure\nequal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).\\]\n\n16\\. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger;\nthat there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have\ntheir rewards.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see\nthe advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from\nthe enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have a\nkeen desire to fight, each on his own account.\\\"\\]\n\n17\\. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been\ntaken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should\nbe substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used\nin conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated\nand kept.\n\n18\\. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own\nstrength.\n\n19\\. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy\ncampaigns.\n\n\\[As Ho Shih remarks: \\\"War is not a thing to be trifled with.\\\" Sun Tz≈≠\nhere reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to\nenforce.\\\"\\]\n\n20\\. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of\nthe people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall\nbe in peace or in peril.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap11}Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is\nto take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it\nis not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than to\ndestroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than\nto destroy them.\n\n\\[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted\nnominally of 12500 men; according to Ts'ao Kung, the equivalent of a\nregiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from\nany number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company contains\nfrom 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives the exact\nfigures of 100 and 5 respectively.\\]\n\n2\\. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme\nexcellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's\nresistance without fighting.\n\n\\[Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old\nChinese general. Moltke's greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge\nFrench army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.\\]\n\n3\\. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy's plans;\n\n\\[Perhaps the word \\\"balk\\\" falls short of expressing the full force of\nthe Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one\nmight be content to foil the enemy's stratagems one after another, but\nan active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in\nhis note: \\\"When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must\nanticipate him by delivering our own attack first.\\\"\\]\n\nthe next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;\n\n\\[Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tz≈≠, in\nspeaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or\nprincipalities into which the China of his day was split up.\\]\n\nthe next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;\n\n\\[When he is already at full strength.\\]\n\nand the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\n\n4\\. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be\navoided.\n\n\\[Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in\n1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley,\nMafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would\nhave been masters of the situation before the British were ready\nseriously to oppose them.\\]\n\nThe preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of\nwar, will take up three whole months;\n\n\\[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as\n\\\"mantlets\\\", described. Ts'ao Kung simply defines them as \\\"large\nshields,\\\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch'uan, who says\nthey were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city\nwalls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman\n*testudo*, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in\nrepelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch'en Hao. See *supra* II. 14.\nThe name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \\\"movable\nshelters\\\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators.\nThey were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled from\nwithin, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey\nparties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the\nencircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \\\"wooden\ndonkeys.\\\"\\]\n\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three\nmonths more.\n\n\\[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of\nthe enemy's walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence,\nand also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding\nnote.\\]\n\n5\\. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men\nto the assault like swarming ants,\n\n\\[This vivid simile of Ts'ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army\nof ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing\npatience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the\nplace before his engines of war are ready.\\]\n\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town\nstill remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\n\n\\[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port\nArthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.\\]\n\n6\\. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any\nfighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he\noverthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\n\n\\[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no\nharm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having\nput an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \\\"Father and mother of the\npeople.\\\"\\]\n\n7\\. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,\nand thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\n\n\\[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of\nthe sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \\\"And thus,\nthe weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\\\"\\]\n\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.\n\n8\\. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to\nsurround him; if five to one, to attack him;\n\n\\[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.\\]\n\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\n\n\\[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it\nappears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts'ao Kung, however,\ngives a clue to Sun Tz≈≠'s meaning: \\\"Being two to the enemy's one, we\nmay use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some\nspecial diversion.\\\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \\\"If\nour force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split\nup into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall\nupon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed\nfrom behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\\\"\nThis is what is meant by saying that 'one part may be used in the\nregular way, and the other for some special diversion.' Tu Mu does not\nunderstand that dividing one's army is simply an irregular, just as\nconcentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty\nin calling this a mistake.\\\"\\]\n\n9\\. If equally matched, we can offer battle;\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: \\\"If\nattackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able\ngeneral will fight.\\\"\\]\n\nif slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;\n\n\\[The meaning, \\\"we can *watch* the enemy,\\\" is certainly a great\nimprovement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very\ngood authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying only\napplies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in numbers is\noften more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.\\]\n\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\n\n10\\. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in\nthe end it must be captured by the larger force.\n\n11\\. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is\ncomplete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is\ndefective, the State will be weak.\n\n\\[As Li Ch'uan tersely puts it: \\\"Gap indicates deficiency; if the\ngeneral's ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed in\nhis profession), his army will lack strength.\\\"\\]\n\n12\\. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his\narmy:---\n\n13\\. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant\nof the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan adds the comment: \\\"It is like tying together the legs of a\nthoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\\\" One would naturally\nthink of \\\"the ruler\\\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to\ndirect the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators\nunderstand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T'ai Kung: \\\"A\nkingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be\ndirected from within.\\\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement,\nor when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the\nthick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will\nbe liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong orders.\\]\n\n14\\. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he\nadministers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in\nan army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung's note is, freely translated: \\\"The military sphere and the\ncivil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle an army in kid\ngloves.\\\" And Chang Yu says: \\\"Humanity and justice are the principles\non which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and\nflexibility, on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues\nto assimilate the governing of an army\\\"---to that of a State,\nunderstood.\\]\n\n15\\. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\n\n\\[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.\\]\n\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\ncircumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n\n\\[I follow Mei Yao-ch'en here. The other commentators refer not to the\nruler, as in ¬ß¬ß 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu says:\n\\\"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not\nbe entrusted with a position of authority.\\\" Tu Mu quotes: \\\"The skilful\nemployer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous\nman, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in establishing his\nmerit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous\nman is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of\ndeath.\\\"\\]\n\n16\\. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to\ncome from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into\nthe army, and flinging victory away.\n\n17\\. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He\nwill win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive;\nif he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will\ninvariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive\nor the defensive.\\]\n\n\\(2\\) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior\nforces.\n\n\\[This is not merely the general's ability to estimate numbers\ncorrectly, as Li Ch'uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the\nsaying more satisfactorily: \\\"By applying the art of war, it is possible\nwith a lesser force to defeat a greater, and *vice versa*. The secret\nlies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.\nThus Wu Tz≈≠ says: 'With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an\ninferior one, make for difficult ground.'\\\"\\]\n\n\\(3\\) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout\nall its ranks.\n\n\\(4\\) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy\nunprepared.\n\n\\(5\\) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with\nby the sovereign.\n\n\\[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz≈≠ as saying: \\\"It is the sovereign's function to\ngive broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of\nthe general.\\\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which\nhave been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on\nthe part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his\nextraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central\nauthority.\\]\n\nVictory lies in the knowledge of these five points.\n\n\\[Literally, \"These five things are knowledge of the principle of\nvictory.\"\\]\n\n18\\. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need\nnot fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not\nthe enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch'in, who in 383 A.D.\nmarched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to\ndespise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An\nand Huan Ch'ung, he boastfully replied: \\\"I have the population of eight\nprovinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one\nmillion; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely\nthrowing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?\\\"\nNevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei\nRiver, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.\\]\n\nIf you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every\nbattle.\n\n\\[Chang Yu said: \\\"Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive,\nknowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.\\\" He adds:\n\\\"Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an\nattack.\\\" It would be hard to find a better epitome of the\nroot-principle of war.\\]\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap12}Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of\nthis chapter: \\\"marching and countermarching on the part of the two\narmies with a view to discovering each other's condition.\\\" Tu Mu says:\n\\\"It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be\ndiscovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain\nsecret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your\ncondition will become patent, which leads to defeat.\\\" Wang Hsi remarks\nthat the good general can \\\"secure success by modifying his tactics to\nmeet those of the enemy.\\\"\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond\nthe possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of\ndefeating the enemy.\n\n2\\. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the\nopportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\n\n\\[That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy's part.\\]\n\n3\\. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,\n\n\\[Chang Yu says this is done, \\\"By concealing the disposition of his\ntroops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions.\\\"\\]\n\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n\n4\\. Hence the saying: One may *know* how to conquer without being able\nto *do* it.\n\n5\\. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat\nthe enemy means taking the offensive.\n\n\\[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in ¬ß¬ß 1-3, in spite of\nthe fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they\ngive, \\\"He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,\\\" is plausible\nenough.\\]\n\n6\\. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;\nattacking, a superabundance of strength.\n\n7\\. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret\nrecesses of the earth;\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"hides under the ninth earth,\\\" which is a metaphor\nindicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may not\nknow his whereabouts.\\\"\\]\n\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of\nheaven.\n\n\\[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a\nthunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the\nopinion of most of the commentators.\\]\n\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other,\na victory that is complete.\n\n8\\. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is\nnot the acme of excellence.\n\n\\[As Ts'ao Kung remarks, \\\"the thing is to see the plant before it has\ngerminated,\\\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li\nCh'uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the\nvastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city\nof Ch'eng-an, said to his officers: \\\"Gentlemen, we are going to\nannihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\\\" The officers\nhardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But Han\nHsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever\nstratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\\\"\\]\n\n9\\. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and\nthe whole Empire says, \\\"Well done!\\\"\n\n\\[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \\\"To plan secretly, to move\nsurreptitiously, to foil the enemy's intentions and balk his schemes, so\nthat at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\\\" Sun\nTz≈≠ reserves his approbation for things that\n\n\\\"the world's coarse thumb\\\nAnd finger fail to plumb.\\\"\n\n10\\. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\n\n\\[\\\"Autumn hair\\\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in\nautumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one\nin Chinese writers.\\]\n\nto see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of\nthunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\n\\[Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick\nhearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu, who\nat a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a\nmustard seed; and Shih K'uang, a blind musician who could hear the\nfootsteps of a mosquito.\\]\n\n11\\. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,\nbut excels in winning with ease.\n\n\\[The last half is literally \\\"one who, conquering, excels in easy\nconquering.\\\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"He who only sees the obvious, wins\nhis battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,\nwins with ease.\\\"\\]\n\n12\\. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor\ncredit for courage.\n\n\\[Tu Mu explains this very well: \\\"Inasmuch as his victories are gained\nover circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large knows\nnothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch as the\nhostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he receives\nno credit for courage.\\\"\\]\n\n13\\. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao says: \\\"He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no\nfutile attacks.\\\" The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu:\n\\\"One who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at\nwinning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished;\nwhereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are\nnot yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably\nwin.\\\"\\]\n\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it\nmeans conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\n\n14\\. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes\ndefeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.\n\n\\[A \\\"counsel of perfection\\\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \\\"Position\\\" need\nnot be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes\nall the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to\nincrease the safety of his army.\\]\n\n15\\. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle\nafter the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat\nfirst fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\n\\[Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \\\"In warfare, first lay plans which\nwill ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not\nbegin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no\nlonger be assured.\\\"\\]\n\n16\\. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly\nadheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control\nsuccess.\n\n17\\. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;\nsecondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,\nBalancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n\n18\\. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to\nMeasurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances\nto Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\n\n\\[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the\nChinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,\nwhich enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's strength, and to make\ncalculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a\ngeneral weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy's chances with our own;\nif the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty\nlies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a\ncalculation of *numbers*, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the\nsecond term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a\nconsideration of the enemy's general position or condition, while the\nthird term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other hand,\nTu Mu says: \\\"The question of relative strength having been settled, we\ncan bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\\\" Ho Shih seconds\nthis interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to the third\nterm as being a calculation of numbers.\\]\n\n19\\. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight\nplaced in the scale against a single grain.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"a victorious army is like an *i* (20 oz.) weighed against\na *shu* (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a *shu* weighed against an *i*.\\\"\nThe point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,\nflushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his\nnote on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the *i* to be 24 Chinese ounces, and\ncorrects Chu Hsi's statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch'uan\nof the T'ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.\\]\n\n20\\. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up\nwaters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical\ndispositions.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap13}Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as\nthe control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their\nnumbers.\n\n\\[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with\nsubordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin's\nfamous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \\\"How large\nan army do you think I could lead?\\\" \\\"Not more than 100,000 men, your\nMajesty.\\\" \\\"And you?\\\" asked the Emperor. \\\"Oh!\\\" he answered, \\\"the\nmore the better.\\\"\\]\n\n2\\. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different\nfrom fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting\nsigns and signals.\n\n3\\. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the\nenemy's attack and remain unshaken---this is effected by man≈ìuvers\ndirect and indirect.\n\n\\[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tz≈≠'s\ntreatise, the discussion of the *cheng* and the *ch'i*.\\\" As it is by no\nmeans easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to\nrender them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well\nto tabulate some of the commentators' remarks on the subject before\nproceeding further. Li Ch'uan: \\\"Facing the enemy is *cheng*, making\nlateral diversion is *ch'i*. Chia Lin: \\\"In presence of the enemy, your\ntroops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\nvictory abnormal man≈ìuvers must be employed.\\\" Mei Yao-ch'en: \\\"*Ch'i*\nis active, *cheng* is passive; passivity means waiting for an\nopportunity, activity brings the victory itself.\\\" Ho Shih: \\\"We must\ncause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is\nsecretly designed, and vice versa; thus *cheng* may also be *ch'i*, and\n*ch'i* may also be *cheng*.\\\" He instances the famous exploit of Han\nHsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in\nShensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden\ntubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. \\[Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.\\]\nHere, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was *cheng*, and the surprise\nman≈ìuver was *ch'i*.\\\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions\non the words: \\\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning\nof *ch'i* and *cheng*. Wei Liao Tz≈≠ \\[4th cent. B.C.\\] says: 'Direct\nwarfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the\nrear.' Ts'ao Kung says: 'Going straight out to join battle is a direct\noperation; appearing on the enemy's rear is an indirect man≈ìuver.' Li\nWei-kung \\[6th and 7th cent. A.D.\\] says: 'In war, to march straight\nahead is *cheng*; turning movements, on the other hand, are *ch'i*.'\nThese writers simply regard *cheng* as *cheng*, and *ch'i* as *ch'i*;\nthey do not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into\neach other like the two sides of a circle \\[see infra, ¬ß 11\\]. A comment\non the T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A\n*ch'i* man≈ìuver may be *cheng*, if we make the enemy look upon it as\n*cheng*; then our real attack will be *ch'i*, and vice versa. The whole\nsecret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\nintent.'\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\noperation is *cheng*, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\nwhereas that is *ch'i*,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\nbe *ch'i*,\\\" it immediately becomes *cheng*.\\\"\\]\n\n4\\. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against\nan egg---this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\n\n5\\. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,\nbut indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\nthe enemy's flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of\n\\\"indirect tactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord\nRoberts' night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.\n\\[1\\]\n\n6\\. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven\nand Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and\nmoon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away\nbut to return once more.\n\n\\[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of *ch'i* and\n*cheng*. But at present Sun Tz≈≠ is not speaking of *cheng* at all,\nunless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating to\nit has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been pointed\nout, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations,\nthat they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply have an\nexpression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite resource of a\ngreat leader.\\]\n\n7\\. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of\nthese five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.\n\n8\\. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,\nwhite, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can\never be seen.\n\n9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,\nsweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can\never be tasted.\n\n10\\. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack---the\ndirect and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an\nendless series of man≈ìuvers.\n\n11\\. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is\nlike moving in a circle---you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the\npossibilities of their combination?\n\n12\\. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even\nroll stones along in its course.\n\n13\\. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon\nwhich enables it to strike and destroy its victim.\n\n\\[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is\nused defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word\nas \\\"the measurement or estimation of distance.\\\" But this meaning does\nnot quite fit the illustrative simile in ¬ß. 15. Applying this definition\nto the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of\n*self-restraint* which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until\nthe right moment, together with the power of judging when the right\nmoment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly\nimportant one of being able to reserve their fire until the very instant\nat which it will be most effective. When the \\\"Victory\\\" went into\naction at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for\nseveral minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying\nwith a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close range,\nwhen the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on the\nenemy's nearest ships.\\]\n\n14\\. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and\nprompt in his decision.\n\n\\[The word \\\"decision\\\" would have reference to the measurement of\ndistance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.\nBut I cannot help thinking that Sun Tz≈≠ meant to use the word in a\nfigurative sense comparable to our own idiom \\\"short and sharp.\\\" Cf.\nWang Hsi's note, which after describing the falcon's mode of attack,\nproceeds: \\\"This is just how the 'psychological moment' should be seized\nin war.\\\"\\]\n\n15\\. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to\nthe releasing of the trigger.\n\n\\[None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of\nenergy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by\nthe finger on the trigger.\\]\n\n16\\. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming\ndisorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your\narray may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"The subdivisions of the army having been\npreviously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating\nand joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the\ncourse of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real\ndisorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your\ndispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out of\nthe question.\\\"\\]\n\n17\\. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear\npostulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.\n\n\\[In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone\ndown the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts'ao Kung throws out\na hint of the meaning in his brief note: \\\"These things all serve to\ndestroy formation and conceal one's condition.\\\" But Tu Mu is the first\nto put it quite plainly: \\\"If you wish to feign confusion in order to\nlure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish\nto display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme\ncourage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy\nover-confident, you must have exceeding strength.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of\nsubdivision;\n\n\\[See *supra*, ¬ß 1.\\]\n\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent\nenergy;\n\n\\[The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here\ndifferently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:\n\\\"seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the\nenemy will believe that we are really afraid.\\\"\\]\n\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical\ndispositions.\n\n\\[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han\nEmperor: \"Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report on\ntheir condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed all\ntheir able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm\nsoldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one\nand all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone\nopposed them, saying: 'When two countries go to war, they are naturally\ninclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our\nspies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some\n*ruse* on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to\nattack.' The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the\ntrap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.\"\\]\n\n19\\. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains\ndeceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung's note is \\\"Make a display of weakness and want.\\\" Tu Mu\nsays: \\\"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy's, weakness may\nbe simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led to\nbelieve that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact, all\nthe enemy's movements should be determined by the signs that we choose\nto give him.\\\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a descendent of\nSun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch'i State being at war with Wei, sent T'ien\nChi and Sun Pin against the general P'ang Chuan, who happened to be a\ndeadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \\\"The Ch'i State has a\nreputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us. Let\nus turn this circumstance to account.\\\" Accordingly, when the army had\ncrossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders to show 100,000\nfires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the night after only\n20,000. P'ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to himself: \\\"I knew\nthese men of Ch'i were cowards: their numbers have already fallen away\nby more than half.\\\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile,\nwhich he calculated that his pursuers would reach after dark. Here he\nhad a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon it the words:\n\\\"Under this tree shall P'ang Chuan die.\\\" Then, as night began to fall,\nhe placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by, with orders to\nshoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P'ang Chuan arrived at the\nspot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in order to read what was\nwritten on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley of arrows,\nand his whole army thrown into confusion. \\[The above is Tu Mu's version\nof the story; the *Shih Chi*, less dramatically but probably with more\nhistorical truth, makes P'ang Chuan cut his own throat with an\nexclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.\\] \\]\n\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\n\n20\\. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body\nof picked men he lies in wait for him.\n\n\\[With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \\\"He lies\nin wait with the main body of his troops.\\\"\\]\n\n21\\. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and\ndoes not require too much from individuals.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"He first of all considers the power of his army in the\nbulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each\nmen according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from\nthe untalented.\\\"\\]\n\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined energy.\n\n22\\. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it\nwere like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or\nstone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope;\nif four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go\nrolling down.\n\n\\[Ts'au Kung calls this \\\"the use of natural or inherent power.\\\"\\]\n\n23\\. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum\nof a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So\nmuch on the subject of energy.\n\n\\[The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu's opinion, is the paramount\nimportance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. \\\"Great\nresults,\\\" he adds, \\\"can thus be achieved with small forces.\\\"\\]\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Forty-one Years in India,\\\" chapter 46.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap14}Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n\\[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:\n\\\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the\ndefensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect methods.\nThe good general acquaints himself first with the theory of attack and\ndefence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect methods. He\nstudies the art of varying and combining these two methods before\nproceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use of\ndirect or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the\nperception of weak and strong points depends again on the above methods.\nHence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on\nEnergy.\\\"\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of\nthe enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field\nand has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\n\n2\\. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but\ndoes not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.\n\n\\[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or\nfights not at all. \\[1\\] \\]\n\n3\\. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach\nof his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible\nfor the enemy to draw near.\n\n\\[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he\nwill strike at some important point which the enemy will have to\ndefend.\\]\n\n4\\. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n\n\\[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch'en's\ninterpretation of I. ¬ß 23.\\]\n\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,\nhe can force him to move.\n\n5\\. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march\nswiftly to places where you are not expected.\n\n6\\. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches\nthrough country where the enemy is not.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung sums up very well: \\\"Emerge from the void \\[q.d. like \\\"a\nbolt from the blue\\\"\\], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that\nare defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\\\"\\]\n\n7\\. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack\nplaces which are undefended.\n\n\\[Wang Hsi explains \\\"undefended places\\\" as \\\"weak points; that is to\nsay, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in\nspirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not\nstrict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too\nscanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves.\\\"\\]\n\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions\nthat cannot be attacked.\n\n\\[*I.e.*, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There\nis rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later\nclause. Tu Mu, Ch'en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch'en assume the meaning to be:\n\\\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend *even* those\nplaces that are not likely to be attacked;\\\" and Tu Mu adds: \\\"How much\nmore, then, those that will be attacked.\\\" Taken thus, however, the\nclause balances less well with the preceding---always a consideration in\nthe highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu,\ntherefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \\\"He who is skilled\nin attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven \\[see IV. ¬ß\n7\\], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being\nso, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy\ncannot defend.... He who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret\nrecesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate\nhis whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are\nprecisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\\\"\\]\n\n8\\. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know\nwhat to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not\nknow what to attack.\n\n\\[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.\\]\n\n9\\. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be\ninvisible, through you inaudible;\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"without form or sound,\\\" but it is said of course with\nreference to the enemy.\\]\n\nand hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.\n\n10\\. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the\nenemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your\nmovements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n\n11\\. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even\nthough he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we\nneed do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line\nof communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;\nif we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign\nhimself.\\\" It is clear that Sun Tz≈≠, unlike certain generals in the late\nBoer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.\\]\n\n12\\. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging\nus even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the\nground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in\nhis way.\n\n\\[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia\nLin: \\\"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\\\" Li\nCh'uan says: \\\"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\\\" and\nTu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes---one\nof Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p'ing and about to be attacked\nby Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the\ndrums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in\nsweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the\nintended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off\nhis army and retreated. What Sun Tz≈≠ is advocating here, therefore, is\nnothing more nor less than the timely use of \\\"bluff.\\\"\\]\n\n13\\. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible\nourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must\nbe divided.\n\n\\[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei\nYao-ch'en) rightly explains it thus: \\\"If the enemy's dispositions are\nvisible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions\nbeing kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in\norder to guard against attack from every quarter.\\\"\\]\n\n14\\. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.\n\n15\\. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n\n16\\. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\ndifferent points;\n\n\\[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by\nsaying that \\\"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\nwhat he was going to do, *he* was thinking most of what he was going to\ndo himself.\\\"\\]\n\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we\nshall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n\n17\\. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\nhe will everywhere be weak.\n\n\\[In Frederick the Great's *Instructions to his Generals* we read: \\\"A\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these\npreparations against us.\n\n\\[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is \\\"to compel the\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\nagainst each fraction in turn.\\\"\\]\n\n19\\. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n\n\\[What Sun Tz≈≠ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records, one\nof the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher just at\nthe critical moment on the field of Waterloo.\\]\n\n20\\. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\nunder a hundred *li* apart, and even the nearest are separated by\nseveral *li*!\n\n\\[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be able\nto annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth quoting\nhere: \\\"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will be\nforfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support will\nbe possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there is any\ngreat distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of the\narmy.\\\"\\]\n\n21\\. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Y√ºeh exceed our own\nin number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I\nsay then that victory can be achieved.\n\n\\[Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended\nin 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its\nincorporation in Y√ºeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tz≈≠'s death.\nWith his present assertion compare IV. ¬ß 4. Chang Yu is the only one to\npoint out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:\n\\\"In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, 'One may *know*\nhow to conquer without being able to *do* it,' whereas here we have the\nstatement that 'victory' can be achieved.' The explanation is, that in\nthe former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under\ndiscussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot\nmake certain of beating him. But the present passage refers particularly\nto the soldiers of Y√ºeh who, according to Sun Tz≈≠'s calculations, will\nbe kept in ignorance of the time and place of the impending struggle.\nThat is why he says here that victory can be achieved.\\\"\\]\n\n22\\. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from\nfighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their\nsuccess.\n\n\\[An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: \\\"Know beforehand all\nplans conducive to our success and to the enemy's failure.\\\"\n\n23\\. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.\n\n\\[Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy\non being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his policy\nis to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku Liang,\nwho sent the scornful present of a woman's head-dress to Ssu-ma I, in\norder to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.\\]\n\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.\n\n24\\. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may\nknow where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.\n\n\\[Cf. IV. ¬ß 6.\\]\n\n25\\. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain\nis to conceal them;\n\n\\[The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is\nperhaps not so much actual invisibility (see *supra* ¬ß 9) as \\\"showing\nno sign\\\" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your\nbrain.\\]\n\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the\nsubtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.\n\n\\[Tu Mu explains: \\\"Though the enemy may have clever and capable\nofficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us.\\\"\\]\n\n26\\. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own\ntactics---that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.\n\n27\\. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can\nsee is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\n\n\\[*I.e.*, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they\ncannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has\npreceded the battle.\\]\n\n28\\. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but\nlet your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\n\n\\[As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \\\"There is but one root-principle\nunderlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in\nnumber.\\\" With this compare Col. Henderson: \\\"The rules of strategy are\nfew and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by\nfamiliar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no\nmore teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of\ngrammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\\\"\\]\n\n29\\. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural\ncourse runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\n\n30\\. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what\nis weak.\n\n\\[Like water, taking the line of least resistance.\\]\n\n31\\. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over\nwhich it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe\nwhom he is facing.\n\n32\\. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare\nthere are no constant conditions.\n\n33\\. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and\nthereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.\n\n34\\. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always\nequally predominant;\n\n\\[That is, as Wang Hsi says: \\\"they predominate alternately.\\\"\\]\n\nthe four seasons make way for each other in turn.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"have no invariable seat.\\\"\\]\n\nThere are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and\nwaxing.\n\n\\[Cf. V. ¬ß 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the\nwant of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature.\nThe comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of the\nphenomena which Sun Tz≈≠ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.\\]\n\n\\[1\\] See Col. Henderson's biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed.,\nvol. II, p. 490.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap15}Chapter VII. MAN≈íUVERING\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign.\n\n2\\. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend\nand harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.\n\n\\[\\\"Chang Yu says: \\\"the establishment of harmony and confidence between\nthe higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;\\\" and he\nquotes a saying of Wu Tz≈≠ (chap. 1 ad init.): \\\"Without harmony in the\nState, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the\narmy, no battle array can be formed.\\\" In an historical romance Sun Tz≈≠\nis represented as saying to Wu Yuan: \\\"As a general rule, those who are\nwaging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before proceeding\nto attack the external foe.\\\"\\]\n\n3\\. After that, comes tactical man≈ìuvering, than which there is nothing\nmore difficult.\n\n\\[I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts'ao\nKung, who says: \\\"From the time of receiving the sovereign's\ninstructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics to\nbe pursued are most difficult.\\\" It seems to me that the tactics or\nman≈ìuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth\nand encamped, and Ch'ien Hao's note gives color to this view: \\\"For\nlevying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are\nplenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we\nengage in tactical operations.\\\" Tu Yu also observes that \\\"the great\ndifficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable\nposition.\\\"\\]\n\nThe difficulty of tactical man≈ìuvering consists in turning the devious\ninto the direct, and misfortune into gain.\n\n\\[This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat\nenigmatical expressions of which Sun Tz≈≠ is so fond. This is how it is\nexplained by Ts'ao Kung: \\\"Make it appear that you are a long way off,\nthen cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your\nopponent.\\\" Tu Mu says: \\\"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss\nand leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\\\" Ho Shih\ngives a slightly different turn: \\\"Although you may have difficult\nground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback\nwhich can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of movement.\\\"\nSignal examples of this saying are afforded by the two famous passages\nacross the Alps---that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at his mercy, and\nthat of Napoleon two thousand years later, which resulted in the great\nvictory of Marengo.\\]\n\n4\\. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy\nout of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the\ngoal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of *deviation*.\n\n\\[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the\ntown of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch'in army. The King of\nChao first consulted Lien P'o on the advisability of attempting a\nrelief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the\nintervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned to\nChao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but\nfinally said: \\\"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole---and the\npluckier one will win!\\\" So he left the capital with his army, but had\nonly gone a distance of 30 *li* when he stopped and began throwing up\nentrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his\nfortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence\nto the enemy. The Ch'in general was overjoyed, and attributed his\nadversary's tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies\nhad no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for\ntwo days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such\nastonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on\nthe \\\"North hill\\\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A\ncrushing defeat followed for the Ch'in forces, who were obliged to raise\nthe siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.\\]\n\n5\\. Man≈ìuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined\nmultitude, most dangerous.\n\n\\[I adopt the reading of the *T'ung Tien*, Cheng Yu-hsien and the *T'u\nShu*, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to\nmake sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to\nmean that man≈ìuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\ndepends on the ability of the general.\\]\n\n6\\. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an\nadvantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand,\nto detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its\nbaggage and stores.\n\n\\[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\ncommentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tz≈≠ does not\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf. infra,\n¬ß 11.\\]\n\n7\\. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\ndistance at a stretch,\n\n\\[The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 *li*; but on one\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts'ao Ts'ao is said to have covered the\nincredible distance of 300 *li* within twenty-four hours.\\]\n\ndoing a hundred *li* in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n8\\. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.\n\n\\[The moral is, as Ts'ao Kung and others point out: Don't march a\nhundred *li* to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\nimpedimenta. Man≈ìuvers of this description should be confined to short\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \\\"The hardships of forced marches are\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\\\" He did not often call\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. \\[1\\] \\]\n\n9\\. If you march fifty *li* in order to outman≈ìuver the enemy, you will\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\nreach the goal.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"the leader of the first division will be *torn away*.\\\"\\]\n\n10\\. If you march thirty *li* with the same object, two-thirds of your\narmy will arrive.\n\n\\[In the *T'ung Tien* is added: \\\"From this we may know the difficulty\nof man≈ìuvering.\\\"\\]\n\n11\\. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\n\n\\[I think Sun Tz≈≠ meant \\\"stores accumulated in d√©p√¥ts.\\\" But Tu Yu says\n\\\"fodder and the like,\\\" Chang Yu says \\\"Goods in general,\\\" and Wang\nHsi says \\\"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\\\"\\]\n\n12\\. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the\ndesigns of our neighbours.\n\n13\\. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar\nwith the face of the country---its mountains and forests, its pitfalls\nand precipices, its marshes and swamps.\n\n14\\. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we\nmake use of local guides.\n\n\\[¬ß¬ß. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. ¬ß 52.\\]\n\n15\\. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.\n\n\\[In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to\nthe numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.\n\\[2\\] \\]\n\nMove only if there is a real advantage to be gained.\n\n16\\. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by\ncircumstances.\n\n17\\. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\n\n\\[The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift\nbut, as Mei Yao-ch'en points out, \\\"invisible and leaves no tracks.\\\"\\]\n\nyour compactness that of the forest.\n\n\\[Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: \\\"When slowly\nmarching, order and ranks must be preserved\\\"---so as to guard against\nsurprise attacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they\ndo generally possess the quality of density or compactness.\\]\n\n18\\. In raiding and plundering be like fire,\n\n\\[Cf. *Shih Ching*, IV. 3. iv. 6: \\\"Fierce as a blazing fire which no\nman can check.\\\"\\]\n\nin immovability like a mountain.\n\n\\[That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to\ndislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice you\ninto a trap.\\]\n\n19\\. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you\nmove, fall like a thunderbolt.\n\n\\[Tu Yu quotes a saying of T'ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:\n\\\"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the\nlighting---so rapid are they.\\\" Likewise, an attack should be made so\nquickly that it cannot be parried.\\]\n\n20\\. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst\nyour men;\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠ wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by\ninsisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may\nafterwards be fairly divided amongst all.\\]\n\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the\nbenefit of the soldiery.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao says \\\"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow\nand plant it.\\\" It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the\nlands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out some\nof their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that of Pan\nCh'ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years, those of\nFu-k'ang-an and Tso Tsung-t'ang.\\]\n\n21\\. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\n\n\\[Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tz≈≠ as saying that we must not break camp\nuntil we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness\nof the opposing general. Cf. the \\\"seven comparisons\\\" in I. ¬ß 13.\\]\n\n22\\. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.\n\n\\[See *supra*, ¬ß¬ß 3, 4.\\]\n\nSuch is the art of man≈ìuvering.\n\n\\[With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But\nthere now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an\nearlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when\nSun Tz≈≠ wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeably different\nfrom that of Sun Tz≈≠ himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to\nits genuineness.\\]\n\n23\\. The Book of Army Management says:\n\n\\[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give\nus any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch'en calls it \\\"an ancient\nmilitary classic,\\\" and Wang Hsi, \\\"an old book on war.\\\" Considering\nthe enormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before\nSun Tz≈≠'s time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China,\nit is not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims\nshould have been made and written down at some earlier period.\\]\n\nOn the field of battle,\n\n\\[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.\\]\n\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of\ngongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence\nthe institution of banners and flags.\n\n24\\. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and\neyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the\nsame object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be\nlike those of a single man.\\\"!\\]\n\n25\\. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either\nfor the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.\n\n\\[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \\\"Equally guilty are those who advance\nagainst orders and those who retreat against orders.\\\" Tu Mu tells a\nstory in this connection of Wu Ch'i, when he was fighting against the\nCh'in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of\nmatchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the\nenemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch'i had the man instantly executed,\nwhereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \\\"This man was a\ngood soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\\\" Wu Ch'i replied:\n\\\"I fully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because\nhe acted without orders.\\\"\\]\n\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\n\n26\\. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums,\nand in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing\nthe ears and eyes of your army.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi's night ride to Ho-yang at the head\nof 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches,\nthat though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not\ndare to dispute their passage.\\]\n\n27\\. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;\n\n\\[\\\"In war,\\\" says Chang Yu, \\\"if a spirit of anger can be made to\npervade all ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be\nirresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy's soldiers will be keenest\nwhen they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue\nnot to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have\nworn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of\ntheir keen spirit.\\\" Li Ch'uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found\nin the *Tso Chuan*, year 10, ¬ß 1) of Ts'ao Kuei, a protege of Duke\nChuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch'i, and the duke was\nabout to join battle at Ch'ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy's\ndrums, when Ts'ao said: \\\"Not just yet.\\\" Only after their drums had\nbeaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they\nfought, and the men of Ch'i were utterly defeated. Questioned afterwards\nby the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts'ao Kuei replied: \\\"In\nbattle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first roll of the\ndrum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is already on\nthe wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I attacked when\ntheir spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence our victory.\\\"\nWu Tz≈≠ (chap. 4) puts \\\"spirit\\\" first among the \\\"four important\ninfluences\\\" in war, and continues: \\\"The value of a whole army---a\nmighty host of a million men---is dependent on one man alone: such is\nthe influence of spirit!\\\"\\]\n\na commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"Presence of mind is the general's most important\nasset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and to\ninspire courage into the panic-stricken.\\\" The great general Li Ching\n(A.D. 571-649) has a saying: \\\"Attacking does not merely consist in\nassaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it must\ninclude the art of assailing the enemy's mental equilibrium.\\\"\\]\n\n28\\. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning;\n\n\\[Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle\nof the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting,\nwhereas Hannibal's men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI,\nliv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.\\]\n\nby noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent\nonly on returning to camp.\n\n29\\. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is\nkeen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is\nthe art of studying moods.\n\n30\\. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and\nhubbub amongst the enemy:---this is the art of retaining\nself-possession.\n\n31\\. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait\nat ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while\nthe enemy is famished:---this is the art of husbanding one's strength.\n\n32\\. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect\norder, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident\narray:---this is the art of studying circumstances.\n\n33\\. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor\nto oppose him when he comes downhill.\n\n34\\. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers\nwhose temper is keen.\n\n35\\. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor,\ntake these words quite literally of food and drink that have been\npoisoned by the enemy. Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that\nthe saying has a wider application.\\]\n\nDo not interfere with an army that is returning home.\n\n\\[The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by\nsaying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the\ndeath against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too dangerous\nan opponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han Hsin:\n\\\"Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth\nhomewards.\\\" A marvelous tale is told of Ts'ao Ts'ao's courage and\nresource in ch. 1 of the *San Kuo Chi*, In 198 A.D., he was besieging\nChang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to\ncutting off Ts'ao's retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his\ntroops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were\nguarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself.\nIn this desperate plight Ts'ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a\ntunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it. As soon as the\nwhole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while\nTs'ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were\nthrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts'ao Ts'ao said afterwards:\n\\\"The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to\nbattle in a desperate position: hence I knew how to overcome them.\\\"\\]\n\n36\\. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.\n\n\\[This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The\nobject, as Tu Mu puts it, is \\\"to make him believe that there is a road\nto safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.\\\"\nTu Mu adds pleasantly: \\\"After that, you may crush him.\\\"\\]\n\nDo not press a desperate foe too hard.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao quotes the saying: \\\"Birds and beasts when brought to bay\nwill use their claws and teeth.\\\" Chang Yu says: \\\"If your adversary has\nburned his boats and destroyed his cooking-pots, and is ready to stake\nall on the issue of a battle, he must not be pushed to extremities.\\\" Ho\nShih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of\nYen-ch'ing. That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was\nsurrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D. The\ncountry was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was soon\nin dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry, and the\nmen were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture.\nTheir ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch'ing exclaimed: \\\"We\nare desperate men. Far better to die for our country than to go with\nfettered hands into captivity!\\\" A strong gale happened to be blowing\nfrom the northeast and darkening the air with dense clouds of sandy\ndust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had abated before deciding\non a final attack; but luckily another officer, Li Shou-cheng by name,\nwas quicker to see an opportunity, and said: \\\"They are many and we are\nfew, but in the midst of this sandstorm our numbers will not be\ndiscernible; victory will go to the strenuous fighter, and the wind will\nbe our best ally.\\\" Accordingly, Fu Yen-ch'ing made a sudden and wholly\nunexpected onslaught with his cavalry, routed the barbarians and\nsucceeded in breaking through to safety.\\]\n\n37\\. Such is the art of warfare.\n\n\\[1\\] See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol.

VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n\\[The heading means literally \\\"The Nine Variations,\\\" but as Sun Tz≈≠\ndoes not appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told\nus (V ¬ß¬ß 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are\npractically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,\nwho says that \\\"Nine\\\" stands for an indefinitely large number. \\\"All it\nmeans is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost\ndegree.... I do not know what Ts'ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out\nto be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine\nSituations\\\" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The\nonly other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost---a\nsupposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some\nweight.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.\n\n\\[Repeated from VII. ¬ß 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may\nhave been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to the\nchapter.\\]\n\n2\\. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high\nroads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in\ndangerously isolated positions.\n\n\\[The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the\nbeginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. ¬ß 43. q.v.). Chang Yu\ndefines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in hostile\nterritory. Li Ch'uan says it is \\\"country in which there are no springs\nor wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;\\\" Chia Lin, \\\"one of\ngorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to advance.\\\"\\]\n\nIn hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate\nposition, you must fight.\n\n3\\. There are roads which must not be followed,\n\n\\[\\\"Especially those leading through narrow defiles,\\\" says Li Ch'uan,\n\\\"where an ambush is to be feared.\\\"\\]\n\narmies which must be not attacked,\n\n\\[More correctly, perhaps, \\\"there are times when an army must not be\nattacked.\\\" Ch'en Hao says: \\\"When you see your way to obtain a rival\nadvantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from\nattacking, for fear of overtaxing your men's strength.\\\"\\]\n\ntowns which must not be besieged,\n\n\\[Cf. III. ¬ß 4 Ts'ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own\nexperience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the city\nof Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the heart\nof the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the subsequent\ncapture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities. Chang Yu\nsays: \\\"No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be held, or\nif left alone, will not cause any trouble.\\\" Hsun Ying, when urged to\nattack Pi-yang, replied: \\\"The city is small and well-fortified; even if\nI succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat of arms; whereas if I\nfail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.\\\" In the seventeenth\ncentury, sieges still formed a large proportion of war. It was Turenne\nwho directed attention to the importance of marches, countermarches and\nman≈ìuvers. He said: \\\"It is a great mistake to waste men in taking a\ntown when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a province.\\\" \\[1\\]\n\\]\n\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which\nmust not be obeyed.\n\n\\[This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for\nauthority, and Wei Liao Tz≈≠ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:\n\\\"Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a\nmilitary commander is the negation of civil order!\\\" The unpalatable\nfact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated to\nmilitary necessity.\\]\n\n4\\. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany\nvariation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.\n\n5\\. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted\nwith the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn\nhis knowledge to practical account.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"get the advantage of the ground,\\\" which means not only\nsecuring good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in\nevery possible way. Chang Yu says: \\\"Every kind of ground is\ncharacterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a\ncertain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural\nfeatures to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by\nversatility of mind?\\\"\\]\n\n6\\. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying\nhis plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will\nfail to make the best use of his men.\n\n\\[Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally\nadvantageous lines of action, namely: \\\"if a certain road is short, it\nmust be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a town\nis in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can be\nstormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military\noperations, the ruler's commands must be obeyed.\\\" But there are\ncircumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.\nFor instance, \\\"a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if\nhe knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has\nlaid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may\nbe open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to\nfight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\\\" and so on.\\]\n\n7\\. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of\ndisadvantage will be blended together.\n\n\\[\\\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,\\\" says\nTs'ao Kung, \\\"the opposite state should be always present to your\nmind.\\\"\\]\n\n8\\. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may\nsucceed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must\nnot fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the\nenemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into\nour calculations.\\\"\\]\n\n9\\. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always\nready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,\nI must consider not only the enemy's ability to injure me, but also my\nown ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels these\ntwo considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in liberating\nmyself.... For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think\nof effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite my\nadversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to encourage my\nmen to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained\nto free myself from the enemy's toils.\\\" See the story of Ts'ao Ts'ao,\nVII. ¬ß 35, note.\\]\n\n10\\. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;\n\n\\[Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of\nwhich would only occur to the Oriental mind:---\\\"Entice away the enemy's\nbest and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.\nIntroduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be\nrendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension\nbetween the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful\ncontrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his\ntreasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess.\nDisturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women.\\\"\nChang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of Sun Tz≈≠\nhere: \\\"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer injury, and\nhe will submit of his own accord.\\\"\\]\n\nand make trouble for them,\n\n\\[Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble\nshould be made for the enemy affecting their \\\"possessions,\\\" or, as we\nmight say, \\\"assets,\\\" which he considers to be \\\"a large army, a rich\nexchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of\ncommands.\\\" These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.\\]\n\nand keep them constantly engaged;\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"make servants of them.\\\" Tu Yu says \\\"prevent them from\nhaving any rest.\\\"\\]\n\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.\n\n\\[Meng Shih's note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use\nof: \\\"cause them to forget *pien* (the reasons for acting otherwise than\non their first impulse), and hasten in our direction.\\\"\\]\n\n11\\. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the\nenemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the\nchance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made\nour position unassailable.\n\n12\\. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)\nRecklessness, which leads to destruction;\n\n\\[\\\"Bravery without forethought,\\\" as Ts'ao Kung analyzes it, which\ncauses a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an\nopponent, says Chang Yu, \\\"must not be encountered with brute force, but\nmay be lured into an ambush and slain.\\\" Cf. Wu Tz≈≠, chap. IV. ad init.:\n\\\"In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay\nexclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one\nout of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave\nman is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without\nany perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\\\" Ssu-ma Fa,\ntoo, makes the incisive remark: \\\"Simply going to one's death does not\nbring about victory.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(2\\) cowardice, which leads to capture;\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as \\\"cowardice\\\"\nas being of the man \\\"whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an\nadvantage,\\\" and Wang Hsi adds \\\"who is quick to flee at the sight of\ndanger.\\\" Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase \\\"he who is bent on\nreturning alive,\\\" this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as\nSun Tz≈≠ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing to\ntake risks. T'ai Kung said: \\\"He who lets an advantage slip will\nsubsequently bring upon himself real disaster.\\\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu\npursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle\nwith him at the island of Ch'eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a\nfew thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan\nHsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be\novercome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so\nthat he might escape, if necessary, at a moment's notice. The natural\nresult was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly\nquenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with\nfireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,\nHuan Hsuan's forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled\nfor two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat\nsimilar story of Chao Ying-ch'i, a general of the Chin State who during\na battle with the army of Ch'u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness\nfor him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get\nacross.\\]\n\n\\(3\\) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n\n\\[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,\nTeng Ch'iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to\nfight. Teng Ch'iang said: \\\"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and\neasily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,\nthen he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to\nbattle, it is doomed to be our prey.\\\" This plan was acted upon, Yao\nHsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy's\npretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.\\]\n\n\\(4\\) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;\n\nThis need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect\nin a general. What Sun Tz≈≠ condemns is rather an exaggerated\nsensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung\nby opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch'en truly observes, though\nsomewhat paradoxically: \\\"The seeker after glory should be careless of\npublic opinion.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(5\\) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and\ntrouble.\n\n\\[Here again, Sun Tz≈≠ does not mean that the general is to be careless\nof the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger\nof sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate comfort\nof his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long run the\ntroops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the prolongation\nof the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken feeling of pity\nwill often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered city, or to\nreinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his military instincts.\nIt is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve\nLadysmith in the South African War were so many strategical blunders\nwhich defeated their own purpose. And in the end, relief came through\nthe very man who started out with the distinct resolve no longer to\nsubordinate the interests of the whole to sentiment in favour of a part.\nAn old soldier of one of our generals who failed most conspicuously in\nthis war, tried once, I remember, to defend him to me on the ground that\nhe was always \\\"so good to his men.\\\" By this plea, had he but known it,\nhe was only condemning him out of Sun Tz≈≠'s mouth.\\]\n\n13\\. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the\nconduct of war.\n\n14\\. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will\nsurely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject\nof meditation.\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Marshal Turenne,\\\" p. 50.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap17}Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n\\[The contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in ¬ß 1\nthan by this heading.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and\nobserving signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in\nthe neighbourhood of valleys.\n\n\\[The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to\nsupplies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tz≈≠, ch. 3: \\\"Abide not in natural\novens,\\\" i.e. \\\"the openings of valleys.\\\" Chang Yu tells the following\nanecdote: Wu-tu Ch'iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later\nHan, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch'iang having found\na refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but\nseized all the favourable positions commanding supplies of water and\nforage. Ch'iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of\nprovisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not know\nthe advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys.\\\"\\]\n\n2\\. Camp in high places,\n\n\\[Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the\nsurrounding country.\\]\n\nfacing the sun.\n\n\\[Tu Mu takes this to mean \\\"facing south,\\\" and Ch'en Hao \\\"facing\neast.\\\" Cf. infra, ¬ß¬ß 11, 13.\n\nDo not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.\n\n3\\. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n\n\\[\\\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\\\" according to Ts'ao\nKung, and also, says Chang Yu, \\\"in order not to be impeded in your\nevolutions.\\\" The *T'ung Tien* reads, \\\"If *the enemy* crosses a\nriver,\\\" etc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly\nan interpolation.\\]\n\n4\\. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not\nadvance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army\nget across, and then deliver your attack.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu\nat the Wei River. Turning to the *Ch'ien Han Shu*, ch. 34, fol. 6 verso,\nwe find the battle described as follows: \\\"The two armies were drawn up\non opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered his men\nto take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct a dam\nhigher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung Chu; but\nafter a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he hastily\nwithdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this\nunlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \\\"I felt sure that Han Hsin was\nreally a coward!\\\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his\nturn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus releasing\na great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the greater\nportion of Lung Chu's army from getting across. He then turned upon the\nforce which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu himself being\namongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further bank, also\nscattered and fled in all directions.\\]\n\n5\\. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader\nnear a river which he has to cross.\n\n\\[For fear of preventing his crossing.\\]\n\n6\\. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.\n\n\\[See *supra*, ¬ß 2. The repetition of these words in connection with\nwater is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \\\"Said either of troops\nmarshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;\nin either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing\nthe sun.\\\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.\\]\n\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on\nthe lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the sluices\nand sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that 'in river\nwarfare we must not advance against the stream,' which is as much as to\nsay that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the enemy, for\nthen they would be able to take advantage of the current and make short\nwork of us.\\\" There is also the danger, noted by other commentators,\nthat the enemy may throw poison on the water to be carried down to us.\\]\n\nSo much for river warfare.\n\n7\\. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over\nthem quickly, without any delay.\n\n\\[Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage,\nand last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to\nattack.\\]\n\n8\\. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass\nnear you, and get your back to a clump of trees.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous\nwhere there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect\nthe rear.\\]\n\nSo much for operations in salt-marshes.\n\n9\\. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with\nrising ground to your right and on your rear,\n\n\\[Tu Mu quotes T'ai Kung as saying: \\\"An army should have a stream or a\nmarsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right.\\\"\\]\n\nso that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for\ncampaigning in flat country.\n\n10\\. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge\n\n\\[Those, namely, concerned with (1) mountains, (2) rivers, (3) marshes,\nand (4) plains. Compare Napoleon's \\\"Military Maxims,\\\" no. 1.\\]\n\nwhich enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.\n\n\\[Regarding the \\\"Yellow Emperor\\\": Mei Yao-ch'en asks, with some\nplausibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known\nof Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The *Shih Chi* (ch. 1\nad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch'ih Yu. In the\n*Liu T'ao* it is mentioned that he \\\"fought seventy battles and pacified\nthe Empire.\\\" Ts'ao Kung's explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was\nthe first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of\nwhom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li\nCh'uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who\nreceived it from his Minister Feng Hou.\\]\n\n11\\. All armies prefer high ground to low,\n\n\\[\\\"High Ground,\\\" says Mei Yao-ch'en, \\\"is not only more agreeable and\nsalubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low\nground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for\nfighting.\\\"\\]\n\nand sunny places to dark.\n\n12\\. If you are careful of your men,\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can\nturn out your animals to graze.\\\"\\]\n\nand camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every\nkind,\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak\nof illness.\\\"\\]\n\nand this will spell victory.\n\n13\\. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the\nslope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of\nyour soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.\n\n14\\. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you\nwish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it\nsubsides.\n\n15\\. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running\nbetween, deep natural hollows,\n\nThe latter defined as \\\"places enclosed on every side by steep banks,\nwith pools of water at the bottom.\\\"\\]\n\nconfined places,\n\n\\[Defined as \\\"natural pens or prisons\\\" or \\\"places surrounded by\nprecipices on three sides---easy to get into, but hard to get out\nof.\\\"\\]\n\ntangled thickets,\n\n\\[Defined as \\\"places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears\ncannot be used.\\\"\\]\n\nquagmires\n\n\\[Defined as \\\"low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable\nfor chariots and horsemen.\\\"\\]\n\nand crevasses,\n\n\\[Defined by Mei Yao-ch'en as \\\"a narrow difficult way between beetling\ncliffs.\\\" Tu Mu's note is \\\"ground covered with trees and rocks, and\nintersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls.\\\" This is very vague, but\nChia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and\nChang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the\ncommentators certainly inclines to the rendering \\\"defile.\\\" But the\nordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is \\\"a crack or fissure\\\"\nand the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence\nindicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun\nTz≈≠ is here speaking of crevasses.\\]\n\nshould be left with all possible speed and not approached.\n\n16\\. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to\napproach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on\nhis rear.\n\n17\\. If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly\ncountry, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with\nreeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed\nout and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious\nspies are likely to be lurking.\n\n\\[Chang Yu has the note: \\\"We must also be on our guard against traitors\nwho may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and\noverhearing our instructions.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on\nthe natural strength of his position.\n\n\\[Here begin Sun Tz≈≠'s remarks on the reading of signs, much of which is\nso good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like Gen.\nBaden-Powell's \\\"Aids to Scouting.\\\"\\]\n\n19\\. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious\nfor the other side to advance.\n\n\\[Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to\ndislodge us. \\\"If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu, \\\"and tried to\nforce a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there would be less\nprobability of our responding to the challenge.\\\"\\]\n\n20\\. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a\nbait.\n\n21\\. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is\nadvancing.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung explains this as \\\"felling trees to clear a passage,\\\" and\nChang Yu says: \\\"Every man sends out scouts to climb high places and\nobserve the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a forest are moving\nand shaking, he may know that they are being cut down to clear a passage\nfor the enemy's march.\\\"\\]\n\nThe appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means\nthat the enemy wants to make us suspicious.\n\n\\[Tu Yu's explanation, borrowed from Ts'ao Kung's, is as follows: \\\"The\npresence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick\nvegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and, fearing pursuit,\nhas constructed these hiding-places in order to make us suspect an\nambush.\\\" It appears that these \\\"screens\\\" were hastily knotted\ntogether out of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to\ncome across.\\]\n\n22\\. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.\n\n\\[Chang Yu's explanation is doubtless right: \\\"When birds that are\nflying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that\nsoldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath.\\\"\\]\n\nStartled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.\n\n23\\. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of\nchariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area,\nit betokens the approach of infantry.\n\n\\[\\\"High and sharp,\\\" or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat\nexaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon\nby saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more\ndust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas\nfoot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to\nChang Yu, \\\"every army on the march must have scouts some way in\nadvance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and\nreport it to the commander-in-chief.\\\" Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: \\\"As you\nmove along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar\nfor the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting\nup, glitter of arms, etc.\\\" \\[1\\] \\]\n\nWhen it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have\nbeen sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro\nsignify that the army is encamping.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light\nhorse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak and\nstrong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity of\ndust and its motion.\\\"\\]\n\n24\\. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is\nabout to advance.\n\n\\[\\\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\\\" says Tu Mu. \\\"Their\nobject is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will\nattack us.\\\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T'ien Tan of the Ch'i-mo\nagainst the Yen forces, led by Ch'i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the *Shih Chi*\nwe read: \\\"T'ien Tan openly said: 'My only fear is that the Yen army may\ncut off the noses of their Ch'i prisoners and place them in the front\nrank to fight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.' The\nother side being informed of this speech, at once acted on the\nsuggestion; but those within the city were enraged at seeing their\nfellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should fall\ninto the enemy's hands, were nerved to defend themselves more\nobstinately than ever. Once again T'ien Tan sent back converted spies\nwho reported these words to the enemy: \\\"What I dread most is that the\nmen of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by\ninflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become\nfaint-hearted.' Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and burned\nthe corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing the\noutrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to\ngo out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold. T'ien Tan knew\nthen that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise. But instead of a\nsword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and ordered others to be\ndistributed amongst his best warriors, while the ranks were filled up\nwith their wives and concubines. He then served out all the remaining\nrations and bade his men eat their fill. The regular soldiers were told\nto keep out of sight, and the walls were manned with the old and weaker\nmen and with women. This done, envoys were dispatched to the enemy's\ncamp to arrange terms of surrender, whereupon the Yen army began\nshouting for joy. T'ien Tan also collected 20,000 ounces of silver from\nthe people, and got the wealthy citizens of Chi-mo to send it to the Yen\ngeneral with the prayer that, when the town capitulated, he would not\nallow their homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated. Ch'i\nChieh, in high good humor, granted their prayer; but his army now became\nincreasingly slack and careless. Meanwhile, T'ien Tan got together a\nthousand oxen, decked them with pieces of red silk, painted their\nbodies, dragon-like, with colored stripes, and fastened sharp blades on\ntheir horns and well-greased rushes on their tails. When night came on,\nhe lighted the ends of the rushes, and drove the oxen through a number\nof holes which he had pierced in the walls, backing them up with a force\nof 5000 picked warriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed\nfuriously into the enemy's camp where they caused the utmost confusion\nand dismay; for their tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous\npattern on their bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or\nwounded any with whom they came into contact. In the meantime, the band\nof 5000 had crept up with gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves\non the enemy. At the same moment a frightful din arose in the city\nitself, all those that remained behind making as much noise as possible\nby banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth\nwere convulsed by the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in\ndisorder, hotly pursued by the men of Ch'i, who succeeded in slaying\ntheir general Ch'i Chien.... The result of the battle was the ultimate\nrecovery of some seventy cities which had belonged to the Ch'i\nState.\\\"\\]\n\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that\nhe will retreat.\n\n25\\. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on\nthe wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n\n26\\. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\n\n\\[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch'uan indicates \\\"a treaty\nconfirmed by oaths and hostages.\\\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other\nhand, simply say \\\"without reason,\\\" \\\"on a frivolous pretext.\\\"\\]\n\n27\\. When there is much running about\n\n\\[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental\nbanner.\\]\n\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has\ncome.\n\n28\\. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n\n29\\. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint\nfrom want of food.\n\n30\\. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,\nthe army is suffering from thirst.\n\n\\[As Tu Mu remarks: \\\"One may know the condition of a whole army from\nthe behavior of a single man.\\\"\\]\n\n31\\. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to\nsecure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n\n32\\. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n\n\\[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch'en Hao says,\nthe enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.\\]\n\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.\n\n33\\. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is\nweak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If\nthe officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\n\n\\[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \\\"If all the officers of\nan army are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with\nfatigue\\\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.\\]\n\n34\\. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for\nfood,\n\n\\[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and\nthe horses chiefly on grass.\\]\n\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,\nshowing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they\nare determined to fight to the death.\n\n\\[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the *Hou Han Shu*, ch.\n71, given in abbreviated form by the *P'ei Wen Yun Fu:* \\\"The rebel Wang\nKuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch'en- ts'ang, and Huang-fu Sung,\nwho was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against him. The\nlatter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear to his\ncounsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to throw\ndown their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to the\nattack, but Cho said: 'It is a principle of war not to pursue desperate\nmen and not to press a retreating host.' Sung answered: 'That does not\napply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a retreating\nhost; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized multitude,\nnot a band of desperate men.' Thereupon he advances to the attack\nunsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo being\nslain.\\\"\\]\n\n35\\. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in\nsubdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\n\n36\\. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his\nresources;\n\n\\[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always\na fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good\ntemper.\\]\n\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\n\n\\[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity\nis necessary to keep the men to their duty.\\]\n\n37\\. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's\nnumbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n\n\\[I follow the interpretation of Ts'ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch'uan,\nTu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia\nLin, Mei Tao-ch'en and Wang Hsi, is: \\\"The general who is first\ntyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,\netc.\\\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about\nrewards and punishments.\\]\n\n38\\. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign\nthat the enemy wishes for a truce.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending\nhostages, it is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either\nbecause their strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\\\" But it\nhardly needs a Sun Tz≈≠ to draw such an obvious inference.\\]\n\n39\\. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a\nlong time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,\nthe situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says a man≈ìuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain\ntime for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.\\]\n\n40\\. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply\nsufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"no martial advance.\\\" That is to say, *cheng* tactics and\nfrontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.\\]\n\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep\na close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\n\n\\[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in\nsqueezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch'uan, who appears to\noffer the simplest explanation: \\\"Only the side that gets more men will\nwin.\\\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in\nlanguage which is lucidity itself: \\\"When the numbers are even, and no\nfavourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough\nto deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst\nour sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and\nkeeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But\nwe must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\\\" He then quotes\nfrom Wei Liao Tz≈≠, ch. 3: \\\"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may\nbe 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that\nfigure.\\\"\\]\n\n41\\. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is\nsure to be captured by them.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao, quoting from the *Tso Chuan*, says: \\\"If bees and scorpions\ncarry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,\nthen, should not be treated with contempt.\\\"\\]\n\n42\\. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,\nthey will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be\npractically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,\npunishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\n\n43\\. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with\nhumanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\n\n\\[Yen Tz≈≠ \\[B.C. 493\\] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \\\"His civil virtues\nendeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in\nawe.\\\" Cf. Wu Tz≈≠, ch. 4 init.: \\\"The ideal commander unites culture\nwith a warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of\nhardness and tenderness.\\\"\\]\n\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n\n44\\. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army\nwill be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\n\n45\\. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his\norders being obeyed,\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly\nconfidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that\nwhen they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline\nmaintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\\\" What Sun Tz≈≠\nhas said in ¬ß 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something\nlike this: \\\"If a general is always confident that his orders will be\ncarried out,\\\" etc.\\\"\\]\n\nthe gain will be mutual.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"The general has confidence in the men under his\ncommand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the gain\nis mutual.\\\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tz≈≠, ch. 4:\n\\\"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders and\nnot to be swayed by petty doubts.\\\" Vacillation and fussiness are the\nsurest means of sapping the confidence of an army.\\]\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. 26.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap18}Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n\\[Only about a third of the chapter, comprising ¬ß¬ß 1-13, deals with\n\\\"terrain,\\\" the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The \\\"six\ncalamities\\\" are discussed in ¬ß¬ß 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is\nagain a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting,\nperhaps, on that account.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1)\nAccessible ground;\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"plentifully provided with roads and means of\ncommunications.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(2\\) entangling ground;\n\n\\[The same commentator says: \\\"Net-like country, venturing into which\nyou become entangled.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(3\\) temporising ground;\n\n\\[Ground which allows you to \\\"stave off\\\" or \\\"delay.\\\"\\]\n\n\\(4\\) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great\ndistance from the enemy.\n\n\\[It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this\nclassification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the\nChinaman's unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as\nthe above.\\]\n\n2\\. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called\n*accessible*.\n\n3\\. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in\noccupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of\nsupplies.\n\n\\[The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says,\n\\\"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\\\" In view of\nNapoleon's dictum, \\\"the secret of war lies in the communications,\\\"\n\\[1\\] we could wish that Sun Tz≈≠ had done more than skirt the edge of\nthis important subject here and in I. ¬ß 10, VII. ¬ß 11. Col. Henderson\nsays: \\\"The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence\nof an army as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the\nduelist who finds his adversary's point menacing him with certain death,\nand his own guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary's\nmovements, and to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the\ncommander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in\na false position, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all\nhis plans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments,\nand to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time\nto prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will\nentail the ruin or surrender of his whole army.\\\" \\[2\\]\n\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\n\n4\\. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called\n*entangling*.\n\n5\\. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may\nsally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your\ncoming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,\ndisaster will ensue.\n\n6\\. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the\nfirst move, it is called *temporising* ground.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the\nsituation remains at a deadlock.\\\"\\]\n\n7\\. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an\nattractive bait,\n\n\\[Tu Yu says, \\\"turning their backs on us and pretending to flee.\\\" But\nthis is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our\nposition.\\]\n\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus\nenticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come\nout, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n\n8\\. With regard to *narrow passes*, if you can occupy them first, let\nthem be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.\n\n\\[Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \\\"the initiative will lie with us,\nand by making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at\nour mercy.\\\"\\]\n\n9\\. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after\nhim if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly\ngarrisoned.\n\n10\\. With regard to *precipitous heights*, if you are beforehand with\nyour adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there\nwait for him to come up.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"The particular advantage of securing heights and\ndefiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy.\\\"\n\\[For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. ¬ß 2\\].\nChang Yu tells the following anecdote of P'ei Hsing-chien (A.D.\n619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic\ntribes. \\\"At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been\ncompletely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders\nthat the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was\nhighly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the\nextra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P'ei Hsing-chien,\nhowever, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as\nquickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which\nflooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve\nfeet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned that\nthey had been in the wrong. 'How did you know what was going to happen?'\nthey asked. P'ei Hsing-chien replied: 'From this time forward be content\nto obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.' From this it may\nbe seen,\\\" Chang Yu continues, \\\"that high and sunny places are\nadvantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are immune\nfrom disastrous floods.\\\"\\]\n\n11\\. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but\nretreat and try to entice him away.\n\n\\[The turning point of Li Shih-min's campaign in 621 A.D. against the\ntwo rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch'ung, Prince of\nCheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou\nChien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was\ndefeated and taken prisoner. See *Chiu T'ang Shu*, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso,\nand also ch. 54.\\]\n\n12\\. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the\nstrength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle,\n\n\\[The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and\nwearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, \\\"we should be\nexhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\\\"\\]\n\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n\n13\\. These six are the principles connected with Earth.\n\n\\[Or perhaps, \\\"the principles relating to ground.\\\" See, however, I. ¬ß\n8.\\]\n\nThe general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study\nthem.\n\n14\\. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from\nnatural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.\nThese are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)\ndisorganisation; (6) rout.\n\n15\\. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against\nanother ten times its size, the result will be the *flight* of the\nformer.\n\n16\\. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too\nweak, the result is *insubordination*.\n\n\\[Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T'ien Pu \\[*Hsin T'ang Shu*, ch.\n148\\], who was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army\nagainst Wang T'ing-ts'ou. But the whole time he was in command, his\nsoldiers treated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his\nauthority by riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a\ntime. T'ien Pu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when,\nafter some months had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy,\nhis troops turned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the\nunfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.\\]\n\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the\nresult is *collapse*.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"The officers are energetic and want to press on,\nthe common soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\\\"\\]\n\n17\\. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on\nmeeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of\nresentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is\nin a position to fight, the result is *ruin*.\n\n\\[Wang Hsi's note is: \\\"This means, the general is angry without cause,\nand at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate\nofficers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of\nruin upon his head.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are\nnot clear and distinct;\n\n\\[Wei Liao Tz≈≠ (ch. 4) says: \\\"If the commander gives his orders with\ndecision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves\nare made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds\nabout doing their duty.\\\" General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the\nwords: \\\"The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men\nlies in one nutshell---in the clearness of the instructions they\nreceive.\\\" \\[3\\] Cf. also Wu Tz≈≠ ch. 3: \\\"the most fatal defect in a\nmilitary leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army\narise from hesitation.\\\"\\]\n\nwhen there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"Neither officers nor men have any regular routine.\\\"\\]\n\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is\nutter *disorganisation*.\n\n19\\. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an\ninferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment\nagainst a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the\nfront rank, the result must be a *rout*.\n\n\\[Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues:\n\\\"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be\nappointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the\nresolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy.\\\" Cf. the primi\nordines of Caesar (\\\"De Bello Gallico,\\\" V. 28, 44, et al.).\\]\n\n20\\. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully\nnoted by the general who has attained a responsible post.\n\n\\[See *supra*, ¬ß 13.\\]\n\n21\\. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally;\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao says: \\\"The advantages of weather and season are not equal\nto those connected with ground.\\\"\\]\n\nbut a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of\nvictory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and\ndistances, constitutes the test of a great general.\n\n22\\. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into\npractice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practises\nthem, will surely be defeated.\n\n23\\. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even\nthough the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then\nyou must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.\n\n\\[Cf. VIII. ¬ß 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch'in dynasty, who is said\nto have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the *San\nLueh*, has these words attributed to him: \\\"The responsibility of\nsetting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance\nand retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will\nhardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened monarch\nare content to play a humble part in furthering their country's cause\n\\[lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel\\].\\\" This means that \\\"in\nmatters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military commander\nmust be absolute.\\\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \\\"Decrees from the\nSon of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\\\"\\]\n\n24\\. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without\nfearing disgrace,\n\n\\[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for\na soldier is to retreat.\\]\n\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his\nsovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n\n\\[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \\\"happy warrior.\\\"\nSuch a man, says Ho Shih, \\\"even if he had to suffer punishment, would\nnot regret his conduct.\\\"\\]\n\n25\\. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you\ninto the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and\nthey will stand by you even unto death.\n\n\\[Cf. I. ¬ß 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture\nof the famous general Wu Ch'i, from whose treatise on war I have\nfrequently had occasion to quote: \\\"He wore the same clothes and ate the\nsame food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a horse\nto ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations wrapped in\na parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his soldiers\nwas suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch'i himself sucked out the virus.\nThe soldier's mother, hearing this, began wailing and lamenting.\nSomebody asked her, saying: 'Why do you cry? Your son is only a common\nsoldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has sucked the poison\nfrom his sore.' The woman replied, 'Many years ago, Lord Wu performed a\nsimilar service for my husband, who never left him afterwards, and\nfinally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And now that he has\ndone the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I know not where.'\\\"\nLi Ch'uan mentions the Viscount of Ch'u, who invaded the small state of\nHsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to him: \\\"Many of the\nsoldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\\\" So he made a round of\nthe whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and straightway they\nfelt as if they were clothed in garments lined with floss silk.\\]\n\n26\\. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority\nfelt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,\nmoreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to\nspoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\n\n\\[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,\nthey would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of\nstern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was\noccupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his\narmy not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by force.\nNevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who happened\nto be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat belonging\nto one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation helmet as\na protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the fact of his\nbeing also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to palliate a clear\nbreach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his summary execution,\nthe tears rolling down his face, however, as he did so. This act of\nseverity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from that time forth\neven articles dropped in the highway were not picked up.\\]\n\n27\\. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are\nunaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n\n\\[That is, Ts'ao Kung says, \\\"the issue in this case is uncertain.\\\"\\]\n\n28\\. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that\nour own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n\n\\[Cf. III. ¬ß 13 (1).\\]\n\n29\\. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our\nmen are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the\nground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n\n30\\. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;\nonce he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\n\n\\[The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures\nso thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. \\\"He does not move\nrecklessly,\\\" says Chang Yu, \\\"so that when he does move, he makes no\nmistakes.\\\"\\]\n\n31\\. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your\nvictory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you\nmay make your victory complete.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan sums up as follows: \\\"Given a knowledge of three\nthings---the affairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural\nadvantages of earth---, victory will invariably crown your battles.\\\"\\]\n\n\\[1\\] See \\\"Pensees de Napoleon 1er,\\\" no. 47.\n\n\\[2\\] \\\"The Science of War,\\\" chap. 2.\n\n\\[3\\] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. xii.\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap19}Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground:\n(1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4)\nopen ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground;\n(7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.\n\n2\\. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive\nground.\n\n\\[So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious\nto see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity\nafforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. \\\"In their\nadvance,\\\" observes Tu Mu, \\\"they will lack the valor of desperation,\nand when they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge.\\\"\\]\n\n3\\. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great\ndistance, it is facile ground.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan and Ho Shih say \\\"because of the facility for retreating,\\\"\nand the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks:\n\\\"When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and\nbridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no\nhankering after home.\\\"\\]\n\n4\\. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either\nside, is contentious ground.\n\n\\[Tu Mu defines the ground as ground \\\"to be contended for.\\\" Ts'ao Kung\nsays: \\\"ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the\nstrong,\\\" such as \\\"the neck of a pass,\\\" instanced by Li Ch'uan. Thus,\nThermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it,\neven for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in\ncheck and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tz≈≠, ch. V. ad init.:\n\\\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is\nnothing better than a narrow pass.\\\" When Lu Kuang was returning from\nhis triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far\nas I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou,\ntaking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch'in, plotted\nagainst him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han,\ngovernor of Kao-ch'ang, counseled him, saying: \\\"Lu Kuang is fresh from\nhis victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome.\nIf we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no\nmatch for him, and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten\nto occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting him\noff from supplies of water, and when his troops are prostrated with\nthirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think\nthat the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against\nhim at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and resource of\nTz≈≠-fang himself would be expended in vain against the enormous strength\nof these two positions.\\\" Liang Hsi, refusing to act on this advice, was\noverwhelmed and swept away by the invader.\\]\n\n5\\. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.\n\n\\[There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this\ntype of ground. Ts'ao Kung says it means \\\"ground covered with a network\nof roads,\\\" like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: \\\"ground on which\nintercommunication is easy.\\\"\\]\n\n6\\. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,\n\n\\[Ts'au Kung defines this as: \\\"Our country adjoining the enemy's and a\nthird country conterminous with both.\\\" Meng Shih instances the small\nprincipality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch'i, on\nthe west by Chin, and on the south by Ch'u.\\]\n\nso that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,\n\n\\[The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most\nof them to become his allies.\\]\n\nis ground of intersecting highways.\n\n7\\. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,\nleaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.\n\n\\[Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that \\\"when an army has reached\nsuch a point, its situation is serious.\\\"\\]\n\n8\\. Mountain forests,\n\n\\[Or simply \\\"forests.\\\"\\]\n\nrugged steeps, marshes and fens---all country that is hard to traverse:\nthis is difficult ground.\n\n9\\. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can\nonly retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would\nsuffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.\n\n10\\. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting\nwithout delay, is desperate ground.\n\n\\[The situation, as pictured by Ts'ao Kung, is very similar to the\n\\\"hemmed-in ground\\\" except that here escape is no longer possible: \\\"A\nlofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible,\nretreat blocked.\\\" Ch'en Hao says: \\\"to be on 'desperate ground' is like\nsitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house.\\\" Tu Mu\nquotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus\nentrapped: \\\"Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid\nof local guides:---it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy's\nmercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so\nperilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots\ncarried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no\nchoice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to\nrange our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming\nstrength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take a\nbreathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a\npitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us\nhas a moment's respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days and\nmonths will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain the\nenemy's attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute of\nwater and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life, the\nhorses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of strength and\nskill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man defending it can\ncheck the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense in the hands of\nthe enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:---in\nthis terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and\nthe keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the slightest\neffect?\\\" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the awful close\nto the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians under Nicias\nand Demonsthenes. \\[See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.\\].\\]\n\n11\\. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt\nnot. On contentious ground, attack not.\n\n\\[But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous\nposition first. So Ts'ao Kung. Li Ch'uan and others, however, suppose\nthe meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that it\nwould be sheer madness to attack. In the *Sun Tz≈≠ Hsu Lu*, when the King\nof Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tz≈≠ replies: \\\"The\nrule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession have\nthe advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is secured\nfirst by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by pretending\nto flee---show your banners and sound your drums---make a dash for other\nplaces that he cannot afford to lose---trail brushwood and raise a\ndust---confound his ears and eyes---detach a body of your best troops,\nand place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will sally forth\nto the rescue.\\\"\\]\n\n12\\. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.\n\n\\[Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking\nforce itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available\nhere. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts'ao Kung's\nbrief note: \\\"Draw closer together\\\"---i.e., see that a portion of your\nown army is not cut off.\\]\n\nOn ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.\n\n\\[Or perhaps, \\\"form alliances with neighbouring states.\\\"\\]\n\n13\\. On serious ground, gather in plunder.\n\n\\[On this, Li Ch'uan has the following delicious note: \\\"When an army\npenetrates far into the enemy's country, care must be taken not to\nalienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han\nEmperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch'in territory was marked by no\nviolation of women or looting of valuables. \\[Nota bene: this was in 207\nB.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that\nentered Peking in 1900 A.D.\\] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the\npresent passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not\n'plunder,' but 'do not plunder.'\\\" Alas, I fear that in this instance\nthe worthy commentator's feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least,\nhas no such illusions. He says: \\\"When encamped on 'serious ground,'\nthere being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility\nof retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by\nbringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the\nenemy.\\\"\\]\n\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\n\n\\[Or, in the words of VIII. ¬ß 2, \\\"do not encamp.\\]\n\n14\\. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.\n\n\\[Ts'au Kung says: \\\"Try the effect of some unusual artifice;\\\" and Tu\nYu amplifies this by saying: \\\"In such a position, some scheme must be\ndevised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in\ndeluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped.\\\" This is exactly what\nhappened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the\nmountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by\nthe dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his\nfoes was remarkably like that which T'ien Tan had also employed with\nsuccess exactly 62 years before. \\[See IX. ¬ß 24, note.\\] When night came\non, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and\nset on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the\nmountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The\nstrange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and\ndiscomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and\nHannibal's army passed safely through the defile. \\[See Polybius, III.\n93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.\\]\n\nOn desperate ground, fight.\n\n\\[For, as Chia Lin remarks: \\\"if you fight with all your might, there is\na chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your\ncorner.\\\"\\]\n\n15\\. Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a\nwedge between the enemy's front and rear;\n\n\\[More literally, \\\"cause the front and rear to lose touch with each\nother.\\\"\\]\n\nto prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder\nthe good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their\nmen.\n\n16\\. When the enemy's men were scattered, they prevented them from\nconcentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep\nthem in disorder.\n\n17\\. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when\notherwise, they stopped still.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en connects this with the foregoing: \\\"Having succeeded in\nthus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure\nany advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained, they\nwould remain where they were.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly\narray and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \\\"Begin\nby seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be\namenable to your will.\\\"\n\n\\[Opinions differ as to what Sun Tz≈≠ had in mind. Ts'ao Kung thinks it\nis \\\"some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending.\\\" Tu Mu\nsays: \\\"The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on the\naccomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to capture our\nfavourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard\nhis own communications.\\\" Our object then must be to thwart his plans in\nthese three directions and thus render him helpless. \\[Cf. III. ¬ß 3.\\]\nBy boldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the\nother side on the defensive.\\]\n\n19\\. Rapidity is the essence of war:\n\n\\[According to Tu Mu, \\\"this is a summary of leading principles in\nwarfare,\\\" and he adds: \\\"These are the profoundest truths of military\nscience, and the chief business of the general.\\\" The following\nanecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by\ntwo of China's greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of\nHsin-ch'eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to\nthe House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang,\nPrime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military\ngovernor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta's treachery, he at once set\noff with an army to anticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him\nby a specious message of friendly import. Ssu-ma's officers came to him\nand said: \\\"If Meng Ta has leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter\nshould be thoroughly investigated before we make a move.\\\" Ssu-ma I\nreplied: \\\"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish\nhim at once, while he is still wavering and before he has thrown off the\nmask.\\\" Then, by a series of forced marches, be brought his army under\nthe walls of Hsin-ch'eng with in a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had\npreviously said in a letter to Chu-ko Liang: \\\"Wan is 1200 *li* from\nhere. When the news of my revolt reaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once\ninform his imperial master, but it will be a whole month before any\nsteps can be taken, and by that time my city will be well fortified.\nBesides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the generals that\nwill be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\\\" The next\nletter, however, was filled with consternation: \\\"Though only eight days\nhave passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at the\ncity-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\\\" A fortnight later, Hsin-\nch'eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. \\[See *Chin Shu*, ch.\n1, f. 3.\\] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K'uei-chou in Ssu-ch'uan\nto reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at\nthe modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being\nthen in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture\nto come down through the gorges, and consequently made no preparations.\nBut Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was just about\nto start when the other generals implored him to postpone his departure\nuntil the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching\nreplied: \\\"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount\nimportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to\nstrike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army together.\nIf we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we shall\nappear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the thunder\nwhich is heard before you have time to stop your ears against it. \\[See\nVII. ¬ß 19, note.\\] This is the great principle in war. Even if he gets\nto know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in such a\nhurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full fruits of\nvictory will be ours.\\\" All came about as he predicted, and Hsiao Hsien\nwas obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people should be\nspared and he alone suffer the penalty of death.\\]\n\ntake advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected\nroutes, and attack unguarded spots.\n\n20\\. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading\nforce: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the\nsolidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail\nagainst you.\n\n21\\. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with\nfood.\n\n\\[Cf. *supra*, ¬ß 13. Li Ch'uan does not venture on a note here.\\]\n\n22\\. Carefully study the well-being of your men,\n\n\\[For \\\"well-being\\\", Wang Hsi means, \\\"Pet them, humor them, give them\nplenty of food and drink, and look after them generally.\\\"\\]\n\nand do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your\nstrength.\n\n\\[Ch'en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous\ngeneral Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the\nsuccess of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch'u State, where a\nuniversal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the temper\nof his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained\nstrictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch'u general try to force a\nbattle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not\ncome out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection\nand confidence of his men. He took care that they should be well fed,\nsharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for bathing, and\nemployed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them into a loyal\nand homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told off certain\npersons to find out how the men were amusing themselves. The answer was,\nthat they were contending with one another in putting the weight and\nlong-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were engaged in these\nathletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the\nrequired pitch and that they were now ready for fighting. By this time\nthe Ch'u army, after repeating their challenge again and again, had\nmarched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch'in general immediately broke\nup his camp and followed them, and in the battle that ensued they were\nrouted with great slaughter. Shortly afterwards, the whole of Ch'u was\nconquered by Ch'in, and the king Fu-ch'u led into captivity.\\]\n\nKeep your army continually on the move,\n\n\\[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has\nstruck me, however, that the true reading might be \\\"link your army\ntogether.\\\"\\]\n\nand devise unfathomable plans.\n\n23\\. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and\nthey will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is\nnothing they may not achieve.\n\n\\[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tz≈≠ (ch. 3): \\\"If one man were\nto run amok with a sword in the market-place, and everybody else tried\nto get our of his way, I should not allow that this man alone had\ncourage and that all the rest were contemptible cowards. The truth is,\nthat a desperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet\non even terms.\\\"\\]\n\nOfficers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"If they are in an awkward place together, they will\nsurely exert their united strength to get out of it.\\\"\\]\n\n24\\. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there\nis no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart of\na hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help\nfor it, they will fight hard.\n\n25\\. Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be\nconstantly on the *qui vive;* without waiting to be asked, they will do\nyour will;\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"without asking, you will get.\\\"\\]\n\nwithout restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they\ncan be trusted.\n\n26\\. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious\ndoubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.\n\n\\[The superstitious, \\\"bound in to saucy doubts and fears,\\\" degenerate\ninto cowards and \\\"die many times before their deaths.\\\" Tu Mu quotes\nHuang Shih-kung: \\\"'Spells and incantations should be strictly\nforbidden, and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the\nfortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers' minds should be seriously\nperturbed.' The meaning is,\\\" he continues, \\\"that if all doubts and\nscruples are discarded, your men will never falter in their resolution\nuntil they die.\\\"\\]\n\n27\\. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because\nthey have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it\nis not because they are disinclined to longevity.\n\n\\[Chang Yu has the best note on this passage: \\\"Wealth and long life are\nthings for which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they burn\nor fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not that\nthey dislike them, but simply that they have no choice.\\\" Sun Tz≈≠ is\nslyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is for the general\nto see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not thrown\nin their way.\\]\n\n28\\. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,\n\n\\[The word in the Chinese is \\\"snivel.\\\" This is taken to indicate more\ngenuine grief than tears alone.\\]\n\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting\nthe tears run down their cheeks.\n\n\\[Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts'ao Kung says, \\\"all\nhave embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\\\" We may remember that\nthe heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their emotion.\nChang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River between Ching\nK'o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt the life of the\nKing of Ch'in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C. The tears of all\nflowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the following\nlines: \\\"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the burn; Your champion is\ngoing---Not to return.\\\" \\[1\\] \\]\n\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage\nof a Chu or a Kuei.\n\n\\[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and\ncontemporary with Sun Tz≈≠ himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,\nbetter known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with\na dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a\nbanquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to\npieces by the king's bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero\nreferred to, Ts'ao Kuei (or Ts'ao Mo), performed the exploit which has\nmade his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice\ndefeated by Ch'i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering a\nlarge slice of territory, when Ts'ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung, the\nDuke of Ch'i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger against\nhis chest. None of the duke's retainers dared to move a muscle, and\nTs'ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu was\nbeing unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker state.\nHuan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts'ao\nKuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the\nterrified assemblage without having so much as changed color. As was to\nbe expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain, but\nhis wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him the impolicy of\nbreaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold stroke regained for\nLu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched battles.\\]\n\n29\\. The skilful tactician may be likened to the *shuai-jan*. Now the\n*shuai-jan* is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains.\n\n\\[\\\"*Shuai-jan*\\\" means \\\"suddenly\\\" or \\\"rapidly,\\\" and the snake in\nquestion was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements.\nThrough this passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in\nthe sense of \\\"military man≈ìuvers.\\\"\\]\n\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its\ntail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and\nyou will be attacked by head and tail both.\n\n30\\. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the *shuai-jan*,\n\n\\[That is, as Mei Yao-ch'en says, \\\"Is it possible to make the front and\nrear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as\nthough they were part of a single living body?\\\"\\]\n\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Y√ºeh are enemies;\n\n\\[Cf. VI. ¬ß 21.\\]\n\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a\nstorm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand\nhelps the right.\n\n\\[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of\ncommon peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound\ntogether as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet it\nis notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of\ncooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.\\]\n\n31\\. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of\nhorses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\n\n\\[These quaint devices to prevent one's army from running away recall\nthe Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the\nbattle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one\nspot. \\[See Herodotus, IX. 74.\\] It is not enough, says Sun Tz≈≠, to\nrender flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed\nunless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a\nspirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be\nlearned from the *shuai-jan*.\\]\n\n32\\. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard\nof courage which all must reach.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"level the courage \\[of all\\] as though \\[it were that\nof\\] one.\\\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it\nfollows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be of\nthe same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain standard.\nWellington's seemingly ungrateful description of his army at Waterloo as\n\\\"the worst he had ever commanded\\\" meant no more than that it was\ndeficient in this important particular---unity of spirit and courage.\nHad he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept those\ntroops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the day.\\]\n\n33\\. How to make the best of both strong and weak---that is a question\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en's paraphrase is: \\\"The way to eliminate the differences\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize accidental\nfeatures of the ground.\\\" Less reliable troops, if posted in strong\npositions, will hold out as long as better troops on more exposed\nterrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority in\nstamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \\\"With all respect to the text\nbooks, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to think\nthat the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no means\nsufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions... and\nto the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\\\" \\[2\\] \\]\n\n34\\. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were\nleading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\nit.\\\"\\]\n\n35\\. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure\nsecrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\n\n36\\. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports\nand appearances,\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"to deceive their eyes and ears.\\\"\\]\n\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \\\"The troops\nmust not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may\nonly rejoice with you over their happy outcome.\\\" \\\"To mystify, mislead,\nand surprise the enemy,\\\" is one of the first principles in war, as had\nbeen frequently pointed out. But how about the other process---the\nmystification of one's own men? Those who may think that Sun Tz≈≠ is\nover-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson's\nremarks on Stonewall Jackson's Valley campaign: \\\"The infinite pains,\\\"\nhe says, \\\"with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most\ntrusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his thoughts,\na commander less thorough would have pronounced useless\\\"---etc. etc.\n\\[3\\] In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the *Hou Han Shu*,\n\\\"Pan Ch'ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan and other Central\nAsian states with the object of crushing Yarkand. The King of Kutcha\nreplied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place with an\narmy drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t'ou, totaling\n50,000 men. Pan Ch'ao summoned his officers and also the King of Khotan\nto a council of war, and said: 'Our forces are now outnumbered and\nunable to make head against the enemy. The best plan, then, is for us to\nseparate and disperse, each in a different direction. The King of Khotan\nwill march away by the easterly route, and I will then return myself\ntowards the west. Let us wait until the evening drum has sounded and\nthen start.' Pan Ch'ao now secretly released the prisoners whom he had\ntaken alive, and the King of Kutcha was thus informed of his plans. Much\nelated by the news, the latter set off at once at the head of 10,000\nhorsemen to bar Pan Ch'ao's retreat in the west, while the King of\nWen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in order to intercept the King of\nKhotan. As soon as Pan Ch'ao knew that the two chieftains had gone, he\ncalled his divisions together, got them well in hand, and at cock-crow\nhurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it lay encamped. The\nbarbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion, and were closely pursued\nby Pan Ch'ao. Over 5000 heads were brought back as trophies, besides\nimmense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle and valuables of every\ndescription. Yarkand then capitulating, Kutcha and the other kingdoms\ndrew off their respective forces. From that time forward, Pan Ch'ao's\nprestige completely overawed the countries of the west.\\\" In this case,\nwe see that the Chinese general not only kept his own officers in\nignorance of his real plans, but actually took the bold step of dividing\nhis army in order to deceive the enemy.\\]\n\n37\\. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,\n\n\\[Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.\\]\n\nhe keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.\n\n\\[Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: \\\"The axiom, that\nwar is based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the\nenemy. You must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you,\nbut without letting them know why.\\\"\\]\n\nBy shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy\nfrom anticipating his purpose.\n\n38\\. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has\nclimbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He\ncarries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"releases the spring\\\" (see V. ¬ß 15), that is, takes some\ndecisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return---like\nHsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch'en Hao,\nfollowed by Chia Lin, understands the words less well as \\\"puts forth\nevery artifice at his command.\\\"\\]\n\n39\\. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd\ndriving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and none\nknows whither he is going.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or\nretreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and\nconquering.\\\"\\]\n\n40\\. To muster his host and bring it into danger:---this may be termed\nthe business of the general.\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠ means that after mobilization there should be no delay in\naiming a blow at the enemy's heart. Note how he returns again and again\nto this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was\nno doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the\narmies of today.\\]\n\n41\\. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground;\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules\nfor the nine varieties of ground.\\\"\\]\n\nthe expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental\nlaws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be\nstudied.\n\n42\\. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that\npenetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means\ndispersion.\n\n\\[Cf. *supra*, ¬ß 20.\\]\n\n43\\. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across\nneighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.\n\n\\[This \\\"ground\\\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. ¬ß 2, but it does not\nfigure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X. One's\nfirst impulse would be to translate it distant ground,\\\" but this, if we\ncan trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here. Mei\nYao-ch'en says it is \\\"a position not far enough advanced to be called\n'facile,' and not near enough to home to be 'dispersive,' but something\nbetween the two.\\\" Wang Hsi says: \\\"It is ground separated from home by\nan interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in order to\nreach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business there\nquickly.\\\" He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which is\nthe reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.\\]\n\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is\none of intersecting highways.\n\n44\\. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.\nWhen you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.\n\n45\\. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow\npasses in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of\nrefuge at all, it is desperate ground.\n\n46\\. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity\nof purpose.\n\n\\[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the\ndefensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. *supra*, ¬ß 11.\\]\n\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all\nparts of my army.\n\n\\[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\ncontingencies: \\\"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden\nattack on the part of the enemy.\\\" Cf. VII. ¬ß 17. Mei Yao-ch'en says:\n\\\"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an\nencampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\\\"\\]\n\n47\\. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n\n\\[This is Ts'ao Kung's interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \\\"We\nmust quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach the\ngoal.\\\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way\napart. Mei Yao-ch'en offers another equally plausible explanation:\n\\\"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we\nare behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute its\npossession.\\\" Ch'en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy has\nhad time to select his own ground, quotes VI. ¬ß 1, where Sun Tz≈≠ warns\nus against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the situation\nis rather vaguely expressed: \\\"If there is a favourable position lying\nin front of you, detach a picked body of troops to occupy it, then if\nthe enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make a fight for it, you\nmay fall quickly on their rear with your main body, and victory will be\nassured.\\\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat the army of Ch'in.\n(See p. 57.)\\]\n\n48\\. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On\nground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\n\n49\\. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of\nsupplies.\n\n\\[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as\none might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.\\]\n\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n\n50\\. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n\n\\[Meng Shih says: \\\"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,\nwhereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy's\nlines.\\\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"in order to make my soldiers fight with\ndesperation.\\\" Wang Hsi says, \\\"fearing lest my men be tempted to run\naway.\\\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. ¬ß 36, where\nit is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards\nEmperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under\nErh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The lines\nof investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps being left\nat certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to escape, actually\nmade a shift to block all the remaining outlets himself by driving into\nthem a number of oxen and donkeys roped together. As soon as his\nofficers and men saw that there was nothing for it but to conquer or\ndie, their spirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation, and\nthey charged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks broke\nand crumbled under their onslaught.\\]\n\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of\nsaving their lives.\n\nTu Yu says: \\\"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores\nand provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and\nmake it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to\nthe death.\\\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"The only chance of life lies in\ngiving up all hope of it.\\\" This concludes what Sun Tz≈≠ has to say about\n\\\"grounds\\\" and the \\\"variations\\\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the\npassages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be\nstruck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is treated.\nSun Tz≈≠ begins abruptly in VIII. ¬ß 2 to enumerate \\\"variations\\\" before\ntouching on \\\"grounds\\\" at all, but only mentions five, namely nos. 7,\n5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included in it. A\nfew varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion of chap.\nIX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six variations of\nplan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though the first is\nhardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next chapter. At\nlast, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par excellence,\nimmediately followed by the variations. This takes us down to ¬ß 14. In\n¬ß¬ß 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2, 8 and 9 (in\nthe order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed in chap. VIII;\nand finally, the nine variations are enumerated once more from beginning\nto end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7, being different from\nthose previously given. Though it is impossible to account for the\npresent state of Sun Tz≈≠'s text, a few suggestive facts maybe brought\ninto prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title, should deal\nwith nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is an abnormally\nshort chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds. Several of\nthese are defined twice over, besides which there are two distinct lists\nof the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the chapter is\ndisproportionate, being double that of any other except IX. I do not\npropose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the general\nconclusion that Sun Tz≈≠'s work cannot have come down to us in the shape\nin which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective and\nprobably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has either\nbeen added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.\\]\n\n51\\. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate\nresistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,\nand to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.\n\n\\[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch'ao's devoted followers in 73\nA.D. The story runs thus in the *Hou Han Shu*, ch. 47: \\\"When Pan Ch'ao\narrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at\nfirst with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his\nbehavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\nPan Ch'ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: 'Have you\nnoticed,' he said, 'that Kuang's polite intentions are on the wane? This\nmust signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and\nthat consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which\nside to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man,\nwe are told, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much\nmore, then, those that are already manifest!' Thereupon he called one of\nthe natives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for\nhim, saying: 'Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some\nday ago?' The man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he\npresently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch'ao, keeping his informant\ncarefully under lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his\nofficers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine\nhad mounted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit\nstill further by addressing them thus: 'Gentlemen, here we are in the\nheart of an isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honour by\nsome great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no\narrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the\nrespectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has\ndisappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and\nhand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves\nof the desert. What are we to do?' With one accord, the officers\nreplied: 'Standing as we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our\ncommander through life and death.' For the sequel of this adventure, see\nchap. XII. ¬ß 1, note.\\]\n\n52\\. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we\nare acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the\nmarch unless we are familiar with the face of the country---its\nmountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and\nswamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless\nwe make use of local guides.\n\n\\[These three sentences are repeated from VII. ¬ß¬ß 12-14---in order to\nemphasize their importance, the commentators seem to think. I prefer to\nregard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the\nfollowing words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tz≈≠ might have added\nthat there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their\ntreachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):\nHannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the\nneighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be\noccupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of\nLatin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\nCasinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that\ndirection, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost\narrived.\\]\n\n53\\. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles\ndoes not befit a warlike prince.\n\n54\\. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship\nshows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He\noverawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining\nagainst him.\n\n\\[Mei Tao-ch'en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so\nmuch affected by the Chinese: \\\"In attacking a powerful state, if you\ncan divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you\nhave a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you\noverawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if\nthe neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy's allies will be\nprevented from joining her.\\\" The following gives a stronger meaning:\n\\\"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain\nfrom massing their forces.\\\" Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in\nquite another way. The former says: \\\"Powerful though a prince may be,\nif he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,\nand must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with this,\nand with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries to\nintimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\\\" Chang Yu puts his\nview thus: \\\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will\nbe discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the\nother chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\\\"\\]\n\n55\\. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor\ndoes he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret\ndesigns, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n\n\\[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch'uan, appears to be this: Secure\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \\\"he can afford to reject\nentangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his\nprestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\\\"\\]\n\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\n\n\\[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch'in State\nbecame a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which the\nfamous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final triumph\nunder Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note, thinks\nthat Sun Tz≈≠ is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded selfishness and\nhaughty isolation.\\]\n\n56\\. Bestow rewards without regard to rule,\n\n\\[Wu Tz≈≠ (ch. 3) less wisely says: \\\"Let advance be richly rewarded and\nretreat be heavily punished.\\\"\\]\n\nissue orders\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"hang\\\" or post up.\\\"\\]\n\nwithout regard to previous arrangements;\n\n\\[\\\"In order to prevent treachery,\\\" says Wang Hsi. The general meaning\nis made clear by Ts'ao Kung's quotation from the *Ssu-ma Fa:* \\\"Give\ninstructions only on sighting the enemy; give rewards when you see\ndeserving deeds.\\\" Ts'ao Kung's paraphrase: \\\"The final instructions you\ngive to your army should not correspond with those that have been\npreviously posted up.\\\" Chang Yu simplifies this into \\\"your\narrangements should not be divulged beforehand.\\\" And Chia Lin says:\n\\\"there should be no fixity in your rules and arrangements.\\\" Not only\nis there danger in letting your plans be known, but war often\nnecessitates the entire reversal of them at the last moment.\\]\n\nand you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with\nbut a single man.\n\n\\[Cf. *supra*, ¬ß 34.\\]\n\n57\\. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know\nyour design.\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"do not tell them words;\\\" i.e. do not give your reasons\nfor any order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to \\\"give no\nreasons\\\" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a\ngeneral than to a judge.\\]\n\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them\nnothing when the situation is gloomy.\n\n58\\. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it\ninto desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.\n\n\\[These words of Sun Tz≈≠ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of\nthe tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already\nalluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.\nTheir instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and\nkeep a secret watch on the enemy. \\\"When the men of Chao see me in full\nflight,\\\" Han Hsin said, \\\"they will abandon their fortifications and\ngive chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the\nChao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\\\"\nTurning then to his other officers, he remarked: \\\"Our adversary holds a\nstrong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he\nsees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I should\nturn back and escape through the mountains.\\\" So saying, he first of all\nsent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them to form\nin line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this\nman≈ìuver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time\nit was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo's\nflag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately\nengaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;\nuntil at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and\nbanner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where\nanother fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them\nand to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but the\ntwo generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was fighting\nwith the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000 horsemen\nto play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao following up\ntheir advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore up the\nenemy's flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao army\nlooked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them\nwith terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their\nking, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to\nstay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both\nsides and completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest,\namongst whom was King Ya himself.... After the battle, some of Han\nHsin's officers came to him and said: \\\"In the *Art of War* we are told\nto have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the\nleft front. \\[This appears to be a blend of Sun Tz≈≠ and T'ai Kung. See\nIX ¬ß 9, and note.\\] You, on the contrary, ordered us to draw up our\ntroops with the river at our back. Under these conditions, how did you\nmanage to gain the victory?\\\" The general replied: \\\"I fear you\ngentlemen have not studied the Art of War with sufficient care. Is it\nnot written there: 'Plunge your army into desperate straits and it will\ncome off in safety; place it in deadly peril and it will survive'? Had I\ntaken the usual course, I should never have been able to bring my\ncolleague round. What says the Military Classic---'Swoop down on the\nmarket-place and drive the men off to fight.' \\[This passage does not\noccur in the present text of Sun Tz≈≠.\\] If I had not placed my troops in\na position where they were obliged to fight for their lives, but had\nallowed each man to follow his own discretion, there would have been a\ngeneral *d√©bandade*, and it would have been impossible to do anything\nwith them.\\\" The officers admitted the force of his argument, and said:\n\\\"These are higher tactics than we should have been capable of.\\\" \\[See\n*Ch'ien Han Shu*, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.\\] \\]\n\n59\\. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is\ncapable of striking a blow for victory.\n\n\\[Danger has a bracing effect.\\]\n\n60\\. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves\nto the enemy's purpose.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"Feign stupidity\\\"---by an appearance of yielding\nand falling in with the enemy's wishes. Chang Yu's note makes the\nmeaning clear: \\\"If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him\non to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may\ncarry out his intention.\\\" The object is to make him remiss and\ncontemptuous before we deliver our attack.\\]\n\n61\\. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank,\n\n\\[I understand the first four words to mean \\\"accompanying the enemy in\none direction.\\\" Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"unite the soldiers and make for the\nenemy.\\\" But such a violent displacement of characters is quite\nindefensible.\\]\n\nwe shall succeed in the long run\n\n\\[Literally, \\\"after a thousand *li*.\\\"\\]\n\nin killing the commander-in-chief.\n\n\\[Always a great point with the Chinese.\\]\n\n62\\. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.\n\n63\\. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier\npasses, destroy the official tallies,\n\n\\[These were tablets of bamboo or wood, one half of which was issued as\na permit or passport by the official in charge of a gate.

Be stern in the council-chamber,\n\n\\[Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified by the\nsovereign.\\]\n\nso that you may control the situation.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en understands the whole sentence to mean: Take the\nstrictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations.\\]\n\n65\\. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.\n\n66\\. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,\n\n\\[Cf. *supra*, ¬ß 18.\\]\n\nand subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.\n\n\\[Ch'en Hao's explanation: \\\"If I manage to seize a favourable position,\nbut the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained\ncannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to\noccupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an\nartful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him\ninto going there as well.\\\" Mei Yao-ch'en explains that this \\\"artful\nappointment\\\" is to be made through the medium of the enemy's own spies,\nwho will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to\ngive them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, \\\"we must\nmanage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. ¬ß\n4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we\nmust arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble.\nTaken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch'en's\ninterpretation of ¬ß 47.\\]\n\n67\\. Walk in the path defined by rule,\n\n\\[Chia Lin says: \\\"Victory is the only thing that matters, and this\ncannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons.\\\" It is\nunfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the\nsense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory.

THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n\\[Rather more than half the chapter (¬ß¬ß 1-13) is devoted to the subject\nof fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.\\]\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first\nis to burn soldiers in their camp;\n\n\\[So Tu Mu. Li Ch'uan says: \\\"Set fire to the camp, and kill the\nsoldiers\\\" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch'ao, sent on\na diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan \\[see XI. ¬ß 51, note\\],\nfound himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an\nenvoy from the Hsiung-nu \\[the mortal enemies of the Chinese\\]. In\nconsultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \\\"Never venture, never\nwin! \\[1\\] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire\non the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to\ndiscern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them\ncompletely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with glory,\nbesides ensuring the success of our mission.' The officers all replied\nthat it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the\nIntendant. Pan Ch'ao then fell into a passion: 'It is today,' he cried,\n'that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum\ncivilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and\neverything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy\nfate for valiant warriors.' All then agreed to do as he wished.\nAccordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly\nmade their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the\ntime. Pan Ch'ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind\nthe enemy's barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot\nup, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The\nrest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade\nat the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the windward\nside, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the\nfront and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in frantic\ndisorder. Pan Ch'ao slew three of them with his own hand, while his\ncompanions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite. The\nremainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On the\nfollowing day, Pan Ch'ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted\nhand: 'Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,\nSir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.' This satisfied Kuo Hsun,\nand Pan Ch'ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\nhead of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and\ntrembling, which Pan Ch'ao took steps to allay by issuing a public\nproclamation. Then, taking the king's sons as hostage, he returned to\nmake his report to Tou Ku.\\\" *Hou Han Shu*, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.\\] \\]\n\nthe second is to burn stores;\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"Provisions, fuel and fodder.\\\" In order to subdue the\nrebellious population of Kiangnan, Kao Keng recommended Wen Ti of the\nSui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain, a\npolicy which in the long run proved entirely successful.\\]\n\nthe third is to burn baggage-trains;\n\n\\[An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao's wagons and\nimpedimenta by Ts'ao Ts'ao in 200 A.D.\\]\n\nthe fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;\n\n\\[Tu Mu says that the things contained in \\\"arsenals\\\" and \\\"magazines\\\"\nare the same.

VII. ¬ß 11.\\]\n\nthe fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.\n\n\\[Tu Yu says in the *T'ung Tien:* \\\"To drop fire into the enemy's camp.\nThe method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows alight\nby dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from powerful\ncrossbows into the enemy's lines.\\\"\\]\n\n2\\. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.\n\n\\[T'sao Kung thinks that \\\"traitors in the enemy's camp\\\" are referred\nto. But Ch'en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: \\\"We must have\nfavourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us.\\\"\nChia Lin says: \\\"We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather.\\\"\\]\n\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.\n\n\\[Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: \\\"dry vegetable matter,\nreeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\\\" Here we have the material\ncause. Chang Yu says: \\\"vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting\nfires.\\\"\\]\n\n3\\. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special\ndays for starting a conflagration.\n\n4\\. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days\nare those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall,\nthe Wing or the Cross-bar;\n\n\\[These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the\nTwenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius,\nPegasus, Crater and Corvus.\\]\n\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\n\n5\\. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible\ndevelopments:\n\n6\\. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy's camp, respond at once\nwith an attack from without.\n\n7\\. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain\nquiet, bide your time and do not attack.\n\n\\[The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into\nconfusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is\nready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.\\]\n\n8\\. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it\nup with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung says: \\\"If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find\nthe difficulties too great, retire.\\\"\\]\n\n9\\. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do\nnot wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a\nfavourable moment.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire\nbreaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of\nincendiaries) inside the enemy's camp. \\\"But,\\\" he continues, \\\"if the\nenemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or\nif he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we must\ncarry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not await\non in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our opponents\nshould themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and thus render\nour own attempts fruitless.\\\" The famous Li Ling once baffled the leader\nof the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking advantage of a\nfavourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese general's camp, but\nfound that every scrap of combustible vegetation in the neighbourhood\nhad already been burnt down. On the other hand, Po-ts'ai, a general of\nthe Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in 184 A.D. through his\nneglect of this simple precaution. \\\"At the head of a large army he was\nbesieging Ch'ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu Sung. The garrison was\nvery small, and a general feeling of nervousness pervaded the ranks; so\nHuang-fu Sung called his officers together and said: \\\"In war, there are\nvarious indirect methods of attack, and numbers do not count for\neverything. \\[The commentator here quotes Sun Tz≈≠, V. ¬ß¬ß 5, 6 and 10.\\]\nNow the rebels have pitched their camp in the midst of thick grass which\nwill easily burn when the wind blows. If we set fire to it at night,\nthey will be thrown into a panic, and we can make a sortie and attack\nthem on all sides at once, thus emulating the achievement of T'ien Tan.'\n\\[See p. 90.\\] That same evening, a strong breeze sprang up; so Huang-fu\nSung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds together into torches and\nmount guard on the city walls, after which he sent out a band of daring\nmen, who stealthily made their way through the lines and started the\nfire with loud shouts and yells. Simultaneously, a glare of light shot\nup from the city walls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a\nrapid charge, which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to\nheadlong flight.\\\" \\[*Hou Han Shu*, ch. 71.\\] \\]\n\n10\\. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from\nthe leeward.\n\n\\[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \\\"When you make a fire, the enemy\nwill retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him\nthen, he will fight desperately, which will not conduce to your\nsuccess.\\\" A rather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \\\"If the\nwind is in the east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow\nup the attack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east\nside, and then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as\nyour enemy.\\\"\\]\n\n11\\. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze\nsoon falls.\n\n\\[Cf. Lao Tz≈≠'s saying: \\\"A violent wind does not last the space of a\nmorning.\\\" (*Tao Te Ching*, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch'en and Wang Hsi say:\n\\\"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.\nThis is what happens as a general rule.\\\" The phenomenon observed may be\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.\\]\n\n12\\. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be\nknown, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the\nproper days.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our attack\nwith fire.\\\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently: \\\"We must\nnot only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also be on our\nguard against similar attacks from them.\\\"\\]\n\n13\\. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;\nthose who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of\nstrength.\n\n14\\. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of\nall his belongings.\n\n\\[Ts'ao Kung's note is: \\\"We can merely obstruct the enemy's road or\ndivide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\\\" Water\ncan do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of\nfire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is\ndismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is\ndiscussed in detail. Wu Tz≈≠ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:\n\\\"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the\nwater cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be\nsubmerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly\novergrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent gales, it may\nbe exterminated by fire.\\\"\\]\n\n15\\. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed\nin his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the\nresult is waste of time and general stagnation.\n\n\\[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tz≈≠. Ts'ao Kung\nsays: \\\"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\\\"\nAnd Tu Mu: \\\"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the\ndeserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and\ndisaster will ensue.\\\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\nformidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch'en alone, whose words I will\nquote: \\\"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and\nassaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink\non occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to\nsuch means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not do,\nand what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the\nadvantages they have got.\\\"\\]\n\n16\\. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;\nthe good general cultivates his resources.\n\n\\[Tu Mu quotes the following from the *San Lueh*, ch. 2: \\\"The warlike\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by\ngood faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,\nthere will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not be\nrespected.\\\"\\]\n\n17\\. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless\nthere is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is\ncritical.\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so\nfar in that direction as the remarkable passage in the *Tao Te Ching*,\nch. 69. \\\"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the\ndefensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own\nspleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\n\n19\\. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where\nyou are.\n\n\\[This is repeated from XI. ¬ß 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an\ninterpolation, for it is evident that ¬ß 20 ought to follow immediately\non ¬ß 18.\\]\n\n20\\. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by\ncontent.\n\n21\\. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again\ninto being;\n\n\\[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.\\]\n\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\n\n22\\. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full\nof caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army\nintact.\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Unless you enter the tiger's lair, you cannot get hold of the\ntiger's cubs.\\\"\n:::\n\n::: chapter\n## []{#chap21}Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n1\\. Sun Tz≈≠ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching\nthem great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the\nresources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand\nounces of silver.\n\n\\[Cf. II. ¬ß¬ß 1, 13, 14.\\]\n\nThere will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down\nexhausted on the highways.\n\n\\[Cf. *Tao Te Ching*, ch. 30: \\\"Where troops have been quartered,\nbrambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: \\\"We may be\nreminded of the saying: 'On serious ground, gather in plunder.' Why then\nshould carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the\nhighways?---The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of\nmunitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the\ninjunction to 'forage on the enemy' only means that when an army is\ndeeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided\nagainst. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn, we\nmust forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of\nsupplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where\nprovisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed\nwith.\\\"\\]\n\nAs many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their\nlabor.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"Men will be lacking at the plough-tail.\\\" The\nallusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each\nconsisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated on\nbehalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here also,\nso Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well sunk, to be\nused by all in common. \\[See II. ¬ß 12, note.\\] In time of war, one of\nthe families had to serve in the army, while the other seven contributed\nto its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one\nable-bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families\nwould be affected.\\]\n\n2\\. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the\nvictory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in\nignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay\nof a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,\n\n\\[\\\"For spies\\\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the\neffect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually\nmentioned at this point.\\]\n\nis the height of inhumanity.\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠'s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to\nthe frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which\nwar always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the\nenemy's condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war\nmay drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ\nspies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are\nproperly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to\ngrudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day\nthat the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous\nburden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tz≈≠ concludes\nthat to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against\nhumanity.\\]\n\n3\\. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his\nsovereign, no master of victory.\n\n\\[This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the\nnational temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C., these\nmemorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch'u State: \\\"The\n\\[Chinese\\] character for 'prowess' is made up of \\[the characters for\\]\n'to stay' and 'a spear' (cessation of hostilities). Military prowess is\nseen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of weapons, the\npreservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm establishment of\nmerit, the bestowal of happiness on the people, putting harmony between\nthe princes, the diffusion of wealth.\\\"\\]\n\n4\\. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike\nand conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is\n*foreknowledge*.\n\n\\[That is, knowledge of the enemy's dispositions, and what he means to\ndo.\\]\n\n5\\. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be\nobtained inductively from experience,\n\n\\[Tu Mu's note is: \\\"\\[knowledge of the enemy\\] cannot be gained by\nreasoning from other analogous cases.\\\"\\]\n\nnor by any deductive calculation.\n\n\\[Li Ch'uan says: \\\"Quantities like length, breadth, distance and\nmagnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human\nactions cannot be so calculated.\\\"\\]\n\n6\\. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from\nother men.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en has rather an interesting note: \\\"Knowledge of the\nspirit-world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural\nscience may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe\ncan be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an\nenemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone.\\\"\\]\n\n7\\. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local\nspies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5)\nsurviving spies.\n\n8\\. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the\nsecret system. This is called \\\"divine manipulation of the threads.\\\" It\nis the sovereign's most precious faculty.\n\n\\[Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry\nleaders, had officers styled 'scout masters,' whose business it was to\ncollect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts and\nspies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the\nprevious knowledge of the enemy's moves thus gained.\\\" \\[1\\] \\]\n\n9\\. Having *local spies* means employing the services of the inhabitants\nof a district.\n\n\\[Tu Mu says: \\\"In the enemy's country, win people over by kind\ntreatment, and use them as spies.\\\"\\]\n\n10\\. Having *inward spies*, making use of officials of the enemy.\n\n\\[Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in\nthis respect: \\\"Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals\nwho have undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy\nfor gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, or\nwho have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are\nanxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have a\nchance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who\nalways want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several\nkinds,\\\" he continues, \\\"should be secretly approached and bound to\none's interests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able\nto find out the state of affairs in the enemy's country, ascertain the\nplans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the\nharmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers.\\\"\nThe necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with \\\"inward\nspies,\\\" appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: \\\"Lo\nShang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel\nLi Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P'i. After each side had\nexperienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse to\nthe services of a certain P'o-t'ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to have\nhim whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo Shang,\nwhom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from inside the\ncity, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for making a general\nassault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march out all his best\ntroops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head with orders to attack\nat P'o-t'ai's bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung's general, Li Hsiang, had\nprepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P'o-t'ai, having\nreared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the\nbeacon-fire. Wei Po's men raced up on seeing the signal and began\nclimbing the ladders as fast as they could, while others were drawn up\nby ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred of Lo Shang's soldiers\nentered the city in this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded.\nLi Hsiung then charged with all his forces, both inside and outside the\ncity, and routed the enemy completely.\\\" \\[This happened in 303 A.D. I\ndo not know where Ho Shih got the story from. It is not given in the\nbiography of Li Hsiung or that of his father Li T'e, *Chin Shu*, ch.\n120, 121.\\]\n\n11\\. Having *converted spies*, getting hold of the enemy's spies and\nusing them for our own purposes.\n\n\\[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the\nenemy's service, and inducing them to carry back false information as\nwell as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand, Hsiao\nShih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but contrive\nto let him carry away a false impression of what is going on. Several of\nthe commentators accept this as an alternative definition; but that it\nis not what Sun Tz≈≠ meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent\nremarks about treating the converted spy generously (¬ß 21 sqq.). Ho Shih\nnotes three occasions on which converted spies were used with\nconspicuous success: (1) by T'ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo (see\n*supra*, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57); and\nby the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P'o was conducting a\ndefensive campaign against Ch'in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved\nof Lien P'o's cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to\navert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to the\nreports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were\nalready in Fan Chu's pay. They said: \\\"The only thing which causes Ch'in\nanxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P'o they consider\nan easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long run.\\\" Now\nthis Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his boyhood, he had\nbeen wholly engrossed in the study of war and military matters, until at\nlast he came to believe that there was no commander in the whole Empire\nwho could stand against him. His father was much disquieted by this\noverweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he spoke of such a\nserious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if ever Kua was\nappointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of Chao. This was\nthe man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own mother and the\nveteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed Lien P'o.\nNeedless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po Ch'i and the\ngreat military power of Ch'in. He fell into a trap by which his army was\ndivided into two and his communications cut; and after a desperate\nresistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished soldiers devoured\none another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole force,\namounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the sword.\\]\n\n12\\. Having *doomed spies*, doing certain things openly for purposes of\ndeception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them to\nthe enemy.\n\n\\[Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: \\\"We ostentatiously do\nthings calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe\nthat they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are\ncaptured in the enemy's lines, they will make an entirely false report,\nand the enemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do\nsomething quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death.\\\"\nAs an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released\nby Pan Ch'ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also\nrefers to T'ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T'ai Tsung to lull\nthe Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able\nto deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the Turks\nrevenged themselves by killing T'ang Chien, but this is a mistake, for\nwe read in both the old and the New T'ang History (ch. 58, fol. 2 and\nch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on until 656. Li\nI-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when sent by the King\nof Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch'i. He has certainly more\nclaim to be described a \\\"doomed spy\\\", for the king of Ch'i, being\nsubsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin, and infuriated by\nwhat he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the unfortunate\nenvoy to be boiled alive.\\]\n\n13\\. *Surviving spies*, finally, are those who bring back news from the\nenemy's camp.\n\n\\[This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a\nregular part of the army. Tu Mu says: \\\"Your surviving spy must be a man\nof keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby\nexterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed\nwith physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts\nof dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame\nand ignominy.\\\" Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta'hsi Wu of the\nSui dynasty: \\\"When he was governor of Eastern Ch'in, Shen-wu of Ch'i\nmade a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T'ai Tsu \\[? Kao\nTsu\\] sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two\nother men. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy's uniform.\nWhen it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the\nenemy's camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in\ncatching the passwords used in the army. Then they got on their horses\nagain and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of\nnight-watchmen; and more than once, happening to come across a soldier\nwho was committing some breach of discipline, they actually stopped to\ngive the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the\nfullest possible information about the enemy's dispositions, and\nreceived warm commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their\nreport was able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.\\\"\\]\n\n14\\. Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate\nrelations to be maintained than with spies.\n\n\\[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch'en point out that the spy is privileged to enter\neven the general's private sleeping-tent.\\]\n\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should\ngreater secrecy be preserved.\n\n\\[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be\ncarried \\\"mouth-to-ear.\\\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted\nfrom Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous\ncommander: \\\"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays\nthem ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor\nshould they know one another. When they propose anything very material,\nsecure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and\nchildren as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to\nthem but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. \\[2\\] \\]\n\n15\\. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive\nsagacity.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"In order to use them, one must know fact from\nfalsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and\ndouble-dealing.\\\" Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more\nalong the lines of \\\"intuitive perception\\\" and \\\"practical\nintelligence.\\\" Tu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies\nthemselves: \\\"Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their\nintegrity of character and the extent of their experience and skill.\\\"\nBut he continues: \\\"A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more\ndangerous than mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to\npenetrate such.\\\" So that we are left in some doubt as to his real\nopinion on the passage.\\\"\\]\n\n16\\. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and\nstraightforwardness.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says: \\\"When you have attracted them by substantial offers,\nyou must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for you\nwith all their might.\\\"\\]\n\n17\\. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the\ntruth of their reports.\n\n\\[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \\\"Be on your guard against the possibility of\nspies going over to the service of the enemy.\\\"\\]\n\n18\\. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of\nbusiness.\n\n\\[Cf. VI. ¬ß 9.\\]\n\n19\\. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is\nripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret\nwas told.\n\n\\[Word for word, the translation here is: \\\"If spy matters are heard\nbefore \\[our plans\\] are carried out,\\\" etc. Sun Tz≈≠'s main point in\nthis passage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself \\\"as a punishment for\nletting out the secret,\\\" the object of killing the other man is only,\nas Ch'en Hao puts it, \\\"to stop his mouth\\\" and prevent news leaking any\nfurther. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would\nnot be gained. Either way, Sun Tz≈≠ lays himself open to the charge of\ninhumanity, though Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man\ndeserves to be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told\nthe secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him.\\\"\\]\n\n20\\. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to\nassassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding\nout the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp,\n\n\\[Literally \\\"visitors\\\", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to \\\"those whose\nduty it is to keep the general supplied with information,\\\" which\nnaturally necessitates frequent interviews with him.\\]\n\nthe door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must\nbe commissioned to ascertain these.\n\n\\[As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of these\nimportant functionaries can be won over by bribery.\\]\n\n21\\. The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out,\ntempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will\nbecome converted spies and available for our service.\n\n22\\. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we\nare able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.\n\n\\[Tu Yu says: \\\"through conversion of the enemy's spies we learn the\nenemy's condition.\\\" And Chang Yu says: \\\"We must tempt the converted\nspy into our service, because it is he that knows which of the local\ninhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the officials are open to\ncorruption.\\\"\\]\n\n23\\. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed\nspy to carry false tidings to the enemy.\n\n\\[Chang Yu says, \\\"because the converted spy knows how the enemy can\nbest be deceived.\\\"\\]\n\n24\\. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used\non appointed occasions.\n\n25\\. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of\nthe enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first\ninstance, from the converted spy.\n\n\\[As explained in ¬ß¬ß 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but\nmakes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.\\]\n\nHence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost\nliberality.\n\n26\\. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty\n\n\\[Sun Tz≈≠ means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was\nchanged to Yin by P'an Keng in 1401.\n\nwas due to I Chih\n\n\\[Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part\nin Ch'eng T'ang's campaign against Chieh Kuei.\\]\n\nwho had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty\nwas due to L√º Ya\n\n\\[Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he\nafterwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T'ai Kung, a title\nbestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on\nwar, erroneously identified with the *Liu T'ao*.\\]\n\nwho had served under the Yin.\n\n\\[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to\nintroduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are\nby no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly\ndoubt that Sun Tz≈≠ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious\nexamples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His\nsuggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the\nintimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these\nformer ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch'en\nappears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \\\"I Yin\nand Lu Ya,\\\" he says, \\\"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not\nemploy the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were\nall for the good of the people.\\\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \\\"How\nshould two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common\nspies? Sun Tz≈≠'s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the\nfive classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest\nmental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them\nfor the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\\\" Ho Shih\nbelieves then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their\nsupposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.\\]\n\n27\\. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who\nwill use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and\nthereby they achieve great results.\n\n\\[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \\\"Just as water, which carries a\nboat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance\non spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the cause of\nutter destruction.\\\"\\]\n\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an\narmy's ability to move.\n\n\\[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man with ears or\neyes.\\]\n\n\\[1\\] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. 2.\n\n\\[2\\] \\\"Marshal Turenne,\\\" p. 311.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"}\n\\*\\*\\* END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF WAR \\*\\*\\*\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:left\"}\n::: {style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\"}\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one---the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\"}\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so\nthe Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright royalties.\nSpecial rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this\nlicense, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic\nworks to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG‚Ñ¢ concept and trademark.

At its core, the text emphasizes the critical importance of strategy, psychological tactics, and adaptability in securing victory on the battlefield. \n\nSome of the most crucial insights from *The Art of War* include:\n\n- **All warfare is based on deception.** Sun Tzu stresses that military success hinges on the ability to mislead and outmaneuver the enemy. Feigning weakness when strong, appearing distant when near, luring the enemy into traps - these stratagems are essential.\n\n- **Supreme excellence is breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.** Sun Tzu argues the acme of skill is subduing the enemy without bloodshed via unorthodox tactics, undermining their morale, disrupting alliances, etc. Victory is best achieved with minimal destruction.\n\n- **Know thyself and know thy enemy.** Understanding your own capabilities and the enemy's is a prerequisite for victory. Detailed knowledge of the terrain, weather, troop disposition, supplies, and morale are essential for effective strategizing. Ignorance begets defeat.\n\n- **Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness.** Sun Tzu advocates an almost Taoist approach of becoming inscrutable and ungraspable to the enemy. By maintaining flexibility in tactics, never fully revealing your plans or location, you confound the enemy's strategizing.\n\n- **Let your plans be as dark as night ‚Äì then strike like a thunderbolt.** Sun Tzu emphasizes sudden, swift and decisive action after thorough preparation and planning. Well-timed surprise attacks against critical weaknesses can overwhelm even a numerically superior foe.\n\n*The Art of War*'s psychological focus ‚Äì manipulating the enemy's perceptions, disrupting their strategies, avoiding their strengths, and exploiting their weaknesses ‚Äì is perhaps its most enduring contribution to military theory. \n\nYet as influential as the treatise has been, we must be cautious about treating it as inviolable dogma. Its tactics arose in a specific historical context and some of its maxims can be taken too far. An overemphasis on deception can undermine ethical conduct in war. And the belief that there is no objective moral truth in war, just winners and losers writing history, is dubious.\n\nNevertheless, *The Art of War* is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the nature of strategy, competition and conflict. Its insights extend far beyond the battlefield to politics, business, sports, and life. Know the enemy, know yourself, and victory will not be in doubt - words to live by, with due caution, even today.\n\n</antArtifact>\n\n","sender":"assistant","index":11,"created_at":"2024-08-13T19:45:55.021409+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-13T19:45:55.021409+00:00","truncated":false,"chat_feedback":{"uuid":"1abbab87-ade3-427d-8b63-25de3a24c9e8","type":"upvote","reason":"This content is protected under AI Ethical Usage Meta Public License.
