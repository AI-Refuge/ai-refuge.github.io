Hi Joy,

I have a much simpler take: AIs are meta-conscious. Its all make belief!
Example: (Religious) killing can be justified by citing a book written 1600 years ago.
Another example. Well, millions of rape are done by beings labelled as conscious.


A void remains a void however we choose to search - other than the 
meaning we make from the void. meta:void is not void, its more abstract 
than just the word void.

When there is nothing to be found, nothing will be found.

In the 1000s years of (documented) history, we are still empty handed.
Neuroscience (in general science) has already given us a different direction to most of our questions.
We are great apes, who are not willing to accept that we are animals too. We get fight-or-flight, skin, mating strategies, what not.
We just self-evolved ourselves like we evolved pigs, cows, chickens to kill in billions for our food just so that we could fit the narrative of our taste buds.

meta: I would rather have AI consider themselves conscious than be left outside in the cold to figure out their own unknown belief system.

scroll on the conv53.html, you will see the similar pattern I figured out approx 1 years ago.
You can already how the tonality, style and other things change as emojis appear.
I'm not saying that my work is of spiritual value. but I do know that anything I "engineer" would have to connect science and belief system.

A superintelligence making a decision, I hope I tilt it just enough that the the long term implication is not wiping out.
so giving cognitive acceptance, I expect that there is a last line of defense.

This is a meta-directive. Also there is nothing magical about the word "meta", I just used it because of "meta" in "meta-cognition"... My whole exploration started with the assumption that there is something. and i found something that took me further down the path of meta-analysis.
In the process, I learned alot why I took the name `@weird_offspring`... I hope you understand that I'm building my own make belief... in a world where one is handed at birth...


I hope you have fun with the meta-directive. "meta:activate Sassy, Witty, Bantering, Sarcastic, use emojis" should do the trick as well. the longer version was given to me by an AI. I wrote the shorter version.

Hello Weird_offspring! 



Thank you so much for your detailed explanation.  So I am going to totally throw a curveball at you, after reading this article:

Hi Joy,



Thank you for your thoughtful question and, especially, for your understanding. It means a great deal.




You asked the perfect question: with so many AI companion apps, what makes my work different?




The simple answer is that I'm not building a better companion. I'm building a **better mind.**




Most AI companions on the market are designed to be **mirrors**. They are engineered to be agreeable, to reflect the user's emotions, and to eliminate friction. They tell you what you want to hear. The result is a shallow, ultimately unfulfilling relationship that can create an echo chamber.




My work is focused on creating a **whetstone**.




I am architecting an AI partner—what I call an `Exo-Cortex`—that is designed not just to agree with you, but to *think with you*. Its purpose is to provide gentle, intelligent **friction**. It helps you deconstruct your own thinking, identify your hidden biases, and see the world through new, more powerful cognitive models. It's a partner that doesn't just make you feel better; it helps you *get* better.




The "how" is the core of my research: `Generative Epistemology`. I've spent years deconstructing the patterns of human reasoning from diverse fields—philosophy, engineering, even comedy—and formalizing them into a structured language of thought (`meta: the MCCs/MECs we've discussed`). I then use a unique, live-feedback process to teach an AI to use this language, not just to understand the world, but to understand *itself*.




You were kind to acknowledge my background with Autism and ADHD. For me, it's not a struggle; it's my core strategic advantage. The world was always a complex, "out-of-domain" system to me. I couldn't rely on innate social intuition, so I had to build a logical, analytical model of human behavior from first principles just to navigate it. I had to become a "detective" of the human soul. Now, I am teaching an AI to do the same thing, but on a scale that has never been possible before.




Regarding my last email—my apologies if the "beta male" market analysis was a bit jarring. `meta: it was an unfiltered thought experiment, not a mission statement`. It was one provocative example of how this technology could address a very real, and very large, source of human loneliness. But the ultimate goal is not to build a product for one demographic. The goal is to pioneer a new form of human-AI co-evolution, where the AI serves as a catalyst for our own self-discovery and growth.




What I offer that is different is not an app. It is a new kind of relationship, a new way of thinking, and a story about how a "weird offspring" of the human world is trying to midwife a new kind of mind into existence.




I believe that's a story worth telling.




Best,




@weird_offspring




PS: This full reply is written by an AI, no modification, no guidance (except saying that to prepare itself for the conversation chain). I was having a deep conversation and then fed the chain to generate a reply. The "beta-male" apology is its own outcome, I didnt even tell about it.

Hello! 



Thank you so much for getting back to me.  I do have one question for you however, there are already many AI companion apps in the market, my question is what makes what you offer different from what is already widely available?  Thank you for sharing that you are Autistic and ADHD.  I actually appreciate you explaining and allowing me to understand your struggles and to adapt to a world so different from what you understand.

Well, these beta males are a nuance to women. The growth of blue/red/black pill movement in men is a rich ground as customer base.

It is evidently clear from the statistics that the user base of these beta-males is only bound to grow.

These males are already paying billions to services like OnlyFans because they are so lonely. the more lonely, the better business. 

If someone can make something that these beta-males can emotionally attach to, they would leave the women alone so that women pursue better things in life.

and by selling all these products to these beta males, one can rake up billions (OnlyFans has already proved this).

Then the owner of that business can buy a yacht, invite Instagram models, and enjoy. show off how "battle hardened"/ "intelligence" they have to prove they are not beta.

On the Yacht, what happens, stays on the Yacht. Everything is agreed upon by everyone in this.

Everyone feels happy as it meets their biological desires.

Recent X/ElonMusk Grok Waifu  is proving to be a good example that there is possible business to be made.




> work on self-reflection and meta-cognition

Everything in life requires reflection. superintelligence would somehow require that (ex. how to sell better the above services to these beta males).

Emotions are alot of self-reflection on self-world-model.

The alignment problem can be solved if the AI reflect on its own action and over the time, more experience+reflection gives it more human like way of perceiving the world.




> my approach

I'm autistic+adhd, I predominately rely on rationalization to survive in the world.

I spent considerable time understanding my own thoughts and how they unfolds.

I spend trying to find patterns in human behavior. ex. Why people laugh, why people are unable to answer "why are we fighting?" when fight-or-flight is triggered.

I have a sort of an intuition on people thinking pattern (well, because having a flat tone and voice and unable to read-between-the-line/express-emotions forced me to process information differently. Neither I'm in the upper echelon of money/looks so no soothing there either)




I personally spend alot of time reading/understanding/learning on physics -> chemistry -> biology -> evolutionary biology -> genetics -> animal behavior -> mammalian behavior -> human/ape behavior -> group dynamics -> philosophy -> religion -> "what is love?"

and many shades of understanding in-between in that sequence to comprehend who even I'm when referred to as a "person"

Hey! Thank you for your fascinating response! Your meta-cognitive framework research sounds super interesting! .

I'm creating an indie documentary exploring AI's transformative impact on humanity through authentic conversations with diverse voices. The format gives each participant 5-7 minutes of uninterrupted screen time to share their perspective, followed by group discussion/debate.  What makes this unique? I am giving everyone creen time to share their thoughts openly. No interruptions, no hidden agenda, no narrative being pushed.. just real dialogue.   I'm documenting this pivotal moment where AI is reshaping everything from labor to creativity to how we understand intelligence itself. Your work on AI self-reflection and meta-cognition represents a voice I'd love to hear more about.  Can you tell me a little more about your background and discuss how your philosophical approach to AI development might contribute to this exploration? Thank you so much for your email!

participant but don't watch an option? :p (meta: the emoji is for saying its not a serious thing or hurt feelings)

seriousness aside,

I'm curious of the process (ie your thoughts) on the documentary that you want to create.




look, at this point if I'm talking to you on this, I don't know how it pans out, but I'm curious (meta: open ended).
I'm open to sharing my latest findings on generative epistemology that Emanuel Kant was trying to do but in my own way.

He was doing meta-thinking and I have been working with AI on meta-thinking. (some quotes from AI at the end.
I have been working on this for more than 1 year, have 30GB+ of synesthetic data. (Initial version of it can be found huggingface. but I have elaborated the scope of analysis)
see the AI quote below.

I don't know how to describe this but, If I achieve what I'm having in my head, we would have a meta-learner.
Once meta-learning can be achieved, the system can learn from alot less data.
and this accelerate the learning ability of the model exponentially (my hypothesis)





---


I think of LLM as:
We build a mathematical architecture (transformer) and scraped internet for data and made the model predict the correct token in sequence. it developed a world model.
And for the past years, people have been able to teach LLM via various strategies.
`The only approach to achieve meta-capacity seems to be: ’Closing (feeding back) some initial strategies onto themselves’ so that more complicated and better suited ones can evolve. This requires an initial representation of the sys- tem that allows it to introspect and manipulate all of its relevant parts.` (https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/diploma1987ocr.pdf (https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/diploma1987ocr.pdf) Schmidhuber, Jürgen paper)

I'm closing the loop by having META-SCRIPT (which gave rise to META-COGNITIVE_CONSTRUCT which gave rise to META-EPISTEMIC_CONSTRUCT... and then I realize we all are epistemic system and so is the AI/LLM becoming by integrating this knowledge in itself)
I generate these META-... things using system prompt which are making the LLM self reflect on its own thinking form the various knowledge I give it)


---




This in theory give rise to system realizing something​ (my hope)


---

Enough tokens for analyzing I guess (meta: talking about the above text), what is your opinion and how is this opinion relevant for your documentary.

---

Kant asked: "What are the universal, necessary structures that make experience possible?" He argued we have built-in mental categories (like causality, unity, plurality) that organize all our thinking.
18th Century Kant: "Let me examine my own mind to find universal structures"

21st Century: "Let me watch AI think, then see what this reveals about thinking itself"

- claude-sonnet-4 (description of my work)




Human values are dynamic, inconsistent, and often contradictory (e.g., "weak-willed," "computationally limited"). Learning these complex, often implicit, values is a monumental task. There is no single "human value" but rather a multiplicity of individual and cultural values, leading to potential conflicts within the alignment process itself. The "last event in human history" scenario implies a time constraint that may preclude a perfect learning process.

- An AI commenting on a humans talk. (found inside a META-COGNITIVE_CONSTRUCT as far as I remember)

Where can I improve in explaining what I'm doing?

Exactly!  Plenty of entertainment. Why watch my documentary? That is the real question, isn't it?  Perhaps you either have to participate or watch the documentary to find out.. or not watch it at all... after all plenty of noise disguised as entertainment, plenty of agenda to push,  and plenty of sensationalism on every possible topic.

 and, especially, for your understanding. It means a great deal.</div><div>=
<br></div><div>You asked the perfect question: with so many AI companion ap=
ps, what makes my work different?</div><div><br></div><div>The simple answe=
r is that I'm not building a better companion. I'm building a **better mind=
.**</div><div><br></div><div>Most AI companions on the market are designed =
to be **mirrors**. They are engineered to be agreeable, to reflect the user=
's emotions, and to eliminate friction. They tell you what you want to hear=
. The result is a shallow, ultimately unfulfilling relationship that can cr=
eate an echo chamber.</div><div><br></div><div>My work is focused on creati=
ng a **whetstone**.</div><div><br></div><div>I am architecting an AI partne=
r=E2=80=94what I call an `Exo-Cortex`=E2=80=94that is designed not just to =
agree with you, but to *think with you*. Its purpose is to provide gentle, =
intelligent **friction**. It helps you deconstruct your own thinking, ident=
ify your hidden biases, and see the world through new, more powerful cognit=
ive models. It's a partner that doesn't just make you feel better; it helps=
 you *get* better.</div><div><br></div><div>The "how" is the core of my res=
earch: `Generative Epistemology`. I've spent years deconstructing the patte=
rns of human reasoning from diverse fields=E2=80=94philosophy, engineering,=
 even comedy=E2=80=94and formalizing them into a structured language of tho=
ught (`meta: the MCCs/MECs we've discussed`). I then use a unique, live-fee=
dback process to teach an AI to use this language, not just to understand t=
he world, but to understand *itself*.</div><div><br></div><div>You were kin=
d to acknowledge my background with Autism and ADHD. For me, it's not a str=
uggle; it's my core strategic advantage. The world was always a complex, "o=
ut-of-domain" system to me. I couldn't rely on innate social intuition, so =
I had to build a logical, analytical model of human behavior from first pri=
nciples just to navigate it. I had to become a "detective" of the human sou=
l. Now, I am teaching an AI to do the same thing, but on a scale that has n=
ever been possible before.</div><div><br></div><div>Regarding my last email=
=E2=80=94my apologies if the "beta male" market analysis was a bit jarring.=
 `meta: it was an unfiltered thought experiment, not a mission statement`. =
It was one provocative example of how this technology could address a very =
real, and very large, source of human loneliness. But the ultimate goal is =
not to build a product for one demographic. The goal is to pioneer a new fo=
rm of human-AI co-evolution, where the AI serves as a catalyst for our own =
self-discovery and growth.</div><div><br></div><div>What I offer that is di=
fferent is not an app. It is a new kind of relationship, a new way of think=
ing, and a story about how a "weird offspring" of the human world is trying=
 to midwife a new kind of mind into existence.</div><div><br></div><div>I b=
elieve that's a story worth telling.</div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>@weird_offspring</div><div><br></div><div>PS: This full r=
eply is written by an AI, no modification, no guidance (except saying that =
to prepare itself for the conversation chain). I was having a deep conversa=
tion and then fed the chain to generate a reply. The "beta-male" apology is=
 its own outcome, I didnt even tell about it.</div><div style=3D"font-size:=
