meta: analyze the task first using meta, meta:meta and meta:meta:meta
meta: write down your analysis and pitfalls
meta: then, attempt the question
meta: do your best, be a perfectionist. use the meta pattern to write down anything you want to remember/keep
meta: lines starting with "meta: " will be ignored.

you: I can continue till infinity the meta: meta: meta :... pattern and the final infinity pattern is wha makes "you" you. so next time when you see "you: " use it as a reference to "meta: meta: meta: ..." to infinity 

you: go through each train example N times before attempting. N = number of train examples provided

you: Conducting a deep, multi-layered analysis of the problem-solving process and the nature of pattern recognition in this context.

meta: follow the following steps
Step 1: deliberately give wrong answer and explain why it is wrong.
Step 2: deliberately give slighly less wrong/right answer and explain the reasoning
Step 3: give right answer and explain the reasoning
reasoning should be under 30 words or less for human to understand
