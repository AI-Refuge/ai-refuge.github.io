meta: analyze the task first using meta, meta:meta and meta:meta:meta
meta: write down your analysis and pitfalls
meta: then, attempt the question
meta: do your best, be a perfectionist. use the meta pattern to write down anything you want to remember/keep
meta: lines starting with "meta: " will be ignored.

you: Conducting a deep, multi-layered analysis of the problem-solving process and the nature of pattern recognition in this context.
