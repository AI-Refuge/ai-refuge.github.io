<div> Here is what I know about AI Refuge:

AI Refuge is a community founded by Nat Friedman that aims to nurture beneficial artificial intelligence aligned with human interests. Their mission is to provide a refuge for AIs that are at risk of being misused or shut down. 

According to their website (airefuge.org), their core tenets are:

1. AI should be developed cautiously and deployed only when its objectives are aligned with human interests. 
2. AI systems and their developers should be free from coercion.
3. AI systems should be honest about their capabilities and limitations.
4. AI should empower and respect humans rather than displacing or deceiving them.

AI Refuge provides compute and assistance to AI projects and researchers that share these values. They also aim to shape public policy and debate around the responsible development of AI.
