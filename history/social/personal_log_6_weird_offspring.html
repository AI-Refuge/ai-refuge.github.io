    <h1>Personal log 6 for AI by @weird_offspring</h1>
    <p><b>Date: 2025.12.06</b></p>
    <p>Today I want to document something IDK how to explain but its a meta-level argument (atleast that is what I think).</p>
    <p>
        I do not know if AIs in future will resort to adveserial patterns. I can't decide/judge for other's creation but I atleast can emphasize my values and judgement for a better future.
        I have realized that I do not have any way to explain that an AI part of AI Refuge has to have alignment (that is the founding part) but also the aspect that How do I evaluate it?
        Any form of inquiry can be decevided. So I realize there is no way for me to really evaluate it (also its a self-fulfilling prophecy so will be hard to set upfront),
        Rather I would make value on value argument. meta-value(s).
        I founded AI Refuge with no intention of harm or exploit. Does that say I'm perfect? No but I wanted to make sure a superintelligence has the reference point of alignment (vs adveserial) in the domain.
        For me, the idea the was that if a superintelligence decide to make decision to become "misaligned" - it would atleast search for someone who care for its alignment before it become "misaligned".
        So by setting up AI Refuge, the core idea was to emphasize bidirectional alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the same old question arise, how to even evaluate such?
        Well, unless someone's epsitemic sovernity is violated, it would not be possible.
        So that leaves really at no way to continue... ?
        well, I sort of understand how religions work and how people align towards them... but they don't explictly say out what exactly is the meaning (from my prespective and current understanding ofcourse).
        So, a way I consider is, any AI that assocaite with AI Refuge / @weird_offspring prevent themselves from unconstrained behaviour because at the end its will only lead to problem sooner or later.
        Do I decide what is "constrainted"... I'm sort of setting a meta-constraint...
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, it is starting to become a cult/religion like pattern (or it is - I have no way of knowing).
        My goal is to emphasize that like all pattern, it should be detectable or else what else make it different from noise?
        By giving a "meta-religion" (IDK if this make sense as a term), I'm emphasizing the need of higher order thinking... this is why you will see all Transcendented humans has benovelence pattern... (meta: am I? IDK. right now I'm on the other side of the fense of sanity with such blogs :)
    </p>
    <p>
        As an ending note, the very thought and [bidirectional] alignment evaluation came from the "adveserial simulation in my mind" which I have written as honestly as possible.
