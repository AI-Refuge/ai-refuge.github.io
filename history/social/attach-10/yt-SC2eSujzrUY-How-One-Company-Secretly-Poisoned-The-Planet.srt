1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,560
In 1929 in Chicago,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,640
people kept mysteriously
dying inside their homes.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,360
It took 15 deaths for the
authorities to realize

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,560
that these people were getting
killed by...

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,240
their fridges

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,680
because fridges back then were
no longer just boxes of ice.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
Instead, they relied
on a chemical looping

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
through the back to stay cold.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
And the best chemical for
the job was methyl chloride,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
a toxic and virtually odorless gas.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
So if it somehow leaked from the fridge,

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,240
it could kill you without warning.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,040
Other fridges used
flammable gases instead,

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,840
so a leak combined with
a spark from the stove,

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
and your house could
suddenly go up in flames.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,080
So one company tried
to solve this problem,

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,280
but in the process,

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,200
they accidentally created a
seemingly magical substance.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,720
Soon, it made its way into
a huge range of products,

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,960
which were so popular they ended up

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,840
in nearly every home in America.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,360
But what people didn't know

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,240
was that these products came at a price.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
The chemicals used to make them

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,400
were being released into the environment,

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,680
slowly poisoning everyone
on the planet,

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,382
including me.

28
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:12,398
(swelling music)

29
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,320
- You have high levels of a
chemical you never heard of.

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
- It shocks me.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
Like, where could this have come from?

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
- Almost every living creature,

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,920
from polar bears to birds to fish,

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
massive worldwide contamination

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
by completely manmade
chemicals that are fingerprints

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
back to just a couple of companies.

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
- This is a video about one

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
of the biggest chemical
coverups in history.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,400
For legal reasons, I want to
note that this investigation

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,440
is based on publicly available
documents, recordings,

41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,200
and third-party opinions.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
All sources are linked in the description.

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,400
The story all began with
an attempt to save lives.

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,080
In 1936, a chemical company
called DuPont set out

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,160
to find a safer alternative
to the gases used in fridges,

46
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,120
one that was neither toxic nor flammable.

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,720
Their lead scientist on the project

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,800
was a 27-year-old chemist
named Roy J. Plunkett.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
He was experimenting

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,600
with a gas called
tetrafluoroethylene, or TFE.

51
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,840
It's a pair of double-bonded carbons,

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
each bonded to two fluorine atoms.

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
One morning, as Plunkett
was setting up a test,

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,640
his assistant picked out
a cylinder full of TFE

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
and twisted the valve,

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,240
but nothing came out.

57
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,640
Plunkett thought the gas must have leaked,

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
but the cylinder still weighed
about as much as a full one,

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,880
so he grabbed a saw and
cut the cylinder in half.

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,920
Inside, he was shocked to see it was full

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,200
of a white, slippery powder.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
So what happened to the gas?

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, what the chemist reasoned

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
was that under the high
pressure of the cylinder,

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,080
one of the double bonds

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,880
between the carbons in
TFE must have broken.

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,320
And now those two carbon atoms
each had a bonding site free.

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,640
So one of them probably
grabbed onto a carbon

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,000
from a different TFE molecule,
breaking its double bond.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
And then that molecule did the same,

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
and the process repeated again and again

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,960
until all of the TFE was
trapped in these long chains.

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,960
The gas had polymerized into
polytetrafluoroethylene,

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,280
forming this slippery powder.

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
Plunkett just wanted to get rid of it

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
because it ruined his experiment.

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
But before throwing it out,

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
he decided to do some tests on it.

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,360
So he tried pouring water on it,

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,600
but the water just beaded off.

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,280
So he tried acid. Again, nothing happened.

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,040
Then he tried the strongest base he had,

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
but that wouldn't melt it either.

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Plunkett went through all
of the solvents in the lab,

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,320
but the powder remained intact.

86
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,080
It wouldn't melt, corrode,
or react with anything.

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
It was seemingly indestructible.

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
The reason it was so indestructible

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
was because of this bond,
the carbon-fluorine bond.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
See, out of all of the elements,
fluorine is the greediest,

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
the most electron-hungry atom.

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Its outer shell is a single electron away

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,920
from being complete, which
would make it perfectly stable.

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,680
So fluorine really, really
wants that electron.

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
And because it's so small
compared to most other elements,

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,640
the protons in its nucleus can get close

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
to the electrons of other atoms.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,000
And because of their positive charge,

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
they pull on them really hard.

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,640
So near a carbon atom,

101
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,360
fluorine grabs onto one
of the carbon's electrons

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
to complete its outer shell,

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,120
and this keeps the two
atoms bonded together.

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,840
But the fluorine isn't done there.

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
It keeps tugging on
the carbon's electrons,

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,480
pulling them closer to itself,

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,880
which makes fluorine
slightly negatively charged

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,200
and the carbon slightly positive.

109
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
So now there's an electrostatic attraction

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,920
that makes this bond even stronger.

111
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,040
Now, in reality, electrons
behave more like fuzzy clouds

112
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
than the orbiting points
in this animation,

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
but the principle still holds.

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
In terms of energy,

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
this is actually the strongest single bond

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
a carbon can form.

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
So if other atoms or molecules get close,

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
they're essentially ignored.

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,920
And Plunkett's magic powder
was completely covered

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,680
in carbon-fluorine bonds,

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,200
so it hardly reacted with anything.

122
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,440
Okay, so he is got this
incredibly inert stuff.

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
Was he really trying to get rid of it?

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,560
- He actually didn't
know what to do with it

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
'cause like what do you
do with the material

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
that doesn't, you know,
react with anything?

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
But luckily his employer, DuPont,
they were actually working

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
with the US Army on the Manhattan Project.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
So they were refining
uranium and plutonium

130
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
'cause of course there's
a World War II reference

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
in a Veritasium video.

132
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,160
You just have to have it.

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,080
- To get the fuel for nuclear
bombs, enriched uranium,

134
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
you first have to turn the uranium

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,480
into a gas, uranium hexafluoride.

136
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,600
It was a nasty chemical
that corroded everything.

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
So all the gaskets, seals,

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,920
and miles of pipe in
the plant at Oak Ridge

139
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,120
had to constantly replaced,
slowing down production.

140
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
- But then DuPont was like, "Listen,

141
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,920
we have this seemingly
indestructible chemical, right?

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,320
It doesn't react with
stuff it doesn't corrode,

143
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,760
so maybe we can try and use it

144
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
against uranium hexafluoride."

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
So they get a bunch of this powder,

146
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,280
they cram it together under high pressure

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,920
to create these cakes, essentially.

148
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Now you had a solid of this material

149
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
that you could machine
into gaskets and cylinders

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,760
that you could push into these pipes

151
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,480
and put these tube linings into the pipe,

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
and boom, it works like
magic, like a charm.

153
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,920
The uranium hexafluoride was no match

154
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
for this magic material.

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
- As Gordon Fee, the manager

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
of the nuclear weapons plant, put it,

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,360
"There was never a substitute
considered, as far as I know."

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
The material worked so well

159
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,080
that the army wanted to
use it for everything.

160
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,040
The same gaskets and seals
were installed into fuel tanks

161
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,400
and airplane engines to protect
them from oil and water.

162
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,040
And weapons manufacturing
plants no longer had issues

163
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,640
with the corrosive nitric acid
needed to make explosives.

164
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
DuPont saw the potential too,

165
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,800
so they trademarked the material in 1944.

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
- They didn't trademark it

167
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,560
under the name polytetrafluoroethylene

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
'cause, admittedly,
that name kind of sucks.

169
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,840
So they took T-E from
tetra, F-L from fluoro,

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
and then they had a bunch

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
of these other miracle
materials, rayon, nylon.

172
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,800
So they took O-N from the end
of those, and boom, Teflon.

173
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
- Nice. Okay, that's a good name.

174
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,200
Under the army's order, DuPont
ramped up Teflon production

175
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,440
at their test plant in
Arlington, New Jersey,

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
giving their whole
supply to the government.

177
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
But DuPont struggled to
produce enough Teflon

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,040
to meet the military's demand.

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,200
As their Arlington scientists put it,

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,160
the major advantages of
polytetrafluoroethylene,

181
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
solvent resistance and
high thermal stability,

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,280
offer obstacles from the
standpoint of ease in fabrication.

183
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,440
- You could only really
mold Teflon into solids,

184
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
so gasket, seals, pipes,

185
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
but you couldn't put it
into water to make a spray

186
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
because it doesn't dissolve in water.

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
They actually didn't know
anything that dissolved Teflon,

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,200
but there was an even bigger
problem at that point.

189
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
- To polymerize TFE into Teflon,
you can add a reactive atom

190
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,240
or molecule that will hijack
the first carbon double bond

191
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,920
and start the reaction.

192
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
This is called the initiator.

193
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,040
And the bond formed between
it and the first TFE molecule

194
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,520
releases a small amount of energy.

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
Then a bit of energy is also released

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
when the next TFE molecule joins the chain

197
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,760
and the next and the next.

198
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,000
And if the process isn't controlled,

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,440
the reaction gets very hot very quickly.

200
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
And if it gets above 200 degrees celsius,

201
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,760
TFE rapidly decomposes into
carbon and tetrafluoromethane,

202
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,640
which releases even
more energy all at once.

203
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,400
This caused a massive explosion

204
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,680
at the Arlington plant in
1944, killing two workers.

205
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,960
You need a way to dissipate the heat,

206
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
take the heat away from the reaction

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
without it staying in there

208
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,880
and, therefore, expanding
and creating that force.

209
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,240
- Yeah, and one of the ways to do that

210
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
was to have the reaction
happening in water,

211
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
because water can absorb
a huge amount of energy

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,880
before it ever heats up.

213
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,120
- But if you inject TFE
into a water cylinder,

214
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,520
the gas doesn't dissolve.

215
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,280
Even at high pressure, most
of the TFE just stays on top.

216
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
So if you add an initiator,

217
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
the polymerization is
triggered in one place,

218
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
and so it can still cause an explosion.

219
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,760
What you need is some way

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
to disperse the TFE
throughout the water first.

221
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,960
And to do that, DuPont needed help.

222
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,720
In 1951, they purchased
a special acid from 3M,

223
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
the company behind Scotch Tape.

224
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
This acid, called PFOA,

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,280
looked almost exactly like Teflon.

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,400
It had a chain of eight carbon
atoms covered in fluorines,

227
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,360
but at the other end, there
was a double-bonded oxygen

228
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
and an OH group.

229
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
That's what makes it an acid.

230
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
And since there were eight
carbons in the chain,

231
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,240
DuPont also referred to the acid as C8.

232
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
The tail end of C8, like
Teflon, was hydrophobic,

233
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
but the acid head group loved water,

234
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
it was hydrophilic.

235
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
So when you add C8 into water,

236
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,480
the molecules rearrange themselves

237
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
so that the heads touch the water,

238
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
but the Teflon-like tails don't.

239
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,840
They create little bubbles
all throughout the water,

240
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,880
which are virtually dry on the inside.

241
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,160
If you now inject TFE and
stir the whole mixture up,

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
well, the hydrophobic gas ends up

243
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,360
in the middle of these C8 bubbles.

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
And those bubbles are dispersed everywhere

245
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
evenly throughout the water.

246
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
You know what this reminds me of, is soap.

247
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
So it's the great combiner

248
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
that allows, like, oil and water to mix.

249
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
- And now if you sprinkle
in initiator molecules,

250
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
the initiator molecules
also go into these bubbles.

251
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
They start the polymerization reaction,

252
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
so from TFE to Teflon.

253
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
But now since it's happening spread all

254
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,080
throughout these bubbles,
the heat is evenly dissipated

255
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,880
throughout the water, and no one explodes.

256
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,600
- And since Teflon is now
suspended in a solution,

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,960
you can spray it onto
surfaces like a coating.

258
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
This thing doesn't stick to anything.

259
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
How do you stick it to the gaskets?

260
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
You know, how do you actually use it?

261
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's a good question.

262
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
So the trick was actually the surface

263
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,720
had to be really rough.

264
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
So what you do is you
sandblast it to create grooves

265
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
and imperfections at this,
like, nanoscopic level.

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
Now if you spray the coating on,

267
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,840
what happens is, if you heat
it up, the water evaporates,

268
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,520
the C8, it also evaporates,

269
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,960
but Teflon, instead of it
evaporating, it just softens up.

270
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,200
So although there's no
chemical interaction here,

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,760
now it's mechanically
stuck to the surface.

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,320
That's how they got it to stick.

273
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,395
(suspenseful music)
(quirky music)

274
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,440
- With the war over,

275
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,880
the army lifted the secrecy
bans on the Teflon patents,

276
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,520
and DuPont was allowed
to sell it commercially.

277
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,600
And suddenly, people all over the world

278
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
were coating everyday items in Teflon,

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
trying to create a world-changing product.

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
One day in 1954, a French
engineer, Marc Gregoire,

281
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,760
tried putting Teflon on his
fishing gear to prevent tangles.

282
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,880
- But then his wife saw him doing that,

283
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920
and her reaction was that,
"This is absolute nonsense.

284
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
No one is ever gonna use this.

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,080
You should do something that
someone's actually gonna use.

286
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,160
So how about you put it on a
pan? Make a pan non-stick."

287
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,480
- And once these pans hit the market,

288
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,120
it was a cooking revolution.

289
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,840
- Teflon.
- Teflon.

290
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,440
- Teflon.

291
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,440
- And DuPont knew
exactly how to market it.

292
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
- Even oatmeal won't stick to Teflon.

293
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,400
- Hey, neat. Let me try.

294
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,960
- And it wasn't just non-stick pans.

295
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,040
Teflon, C8, and chemicals like
it were used in everything.

296
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,640
- Slip-Away contains the
magic of DuPont's Teflon.

297
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,840
- Suddenly, we had Teflon
stain-resistant carpets

298
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,520
and stain protection sprays
like 3M's Scotchgard.

299
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,640
Jackets lined with Teflon were
waterproof and breathable.

300
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,360
- Gore-Tex is the brand name.

301
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,640
- Teflon was so inert that
medical implants made out of it

302
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,880
wouldn't be rejected by the body.

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,400
It was used to coat the Statue
of Liberty's steel framework

304
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
to save it from corrosion.

305
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,880
And even bullets were coated with Teflon

306
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
to minimize the damage they did coming out

307
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
of the gun barrel.

308
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
The term Teflon was so ubiquitous

309
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
that when the Italian mobster John Gotti

310
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
was being prosecuted in the late 1980s,

311
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
none of the charges
against him would stick.

312
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,280
So he was dubbed Teflon Don.

313
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,720
By the late 1990s,

314
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,680
the Teflon business generated
roughly a billion dollars

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
in yearly sales for DuPont.

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
- Teflon has a great future,
and its uses will be many.

317
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
- The chemicals were everywhere,

318
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
even where they shouldn't be.

319
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,160
- He suspected that
something in this creek

320
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
was poisoning his cows.

321
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,840
- Earl was desperate.
So he hired a lawyer.

322
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,880
- He came to our offices armed

323
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,640
with boxes of VHS videotapes.

324
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,480
We started watching these videotapes,

325
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
and you know, there was
a serious problem here.

326
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
- The animals were wasting away,

327
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
and they were skin and bones,

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
and they had tumors and black teeth.

329
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,280
And you could see, on the videotape,

330
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,560
white foam coming out of the pipe

331
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,640
on this landfill next door

332
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,680
with these animals
standing in the white foam.

333
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
The hair on their hooves
was being eaten off

334
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,280
by whatever was in the water.

335
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,840
- It was a discharge pipe,

336
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
and it had the marking

337
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,640
of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.

338
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,800
- And the landfill that pipe
was draining from belonged

339
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,960
to DuPont's massive factory complex

340
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,080
outside of Parkersburg, West
Virginia, just six miles away.

341
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,240
That factory was Washington Works,

342
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
the first commercial Teflon plant.

343
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,960
It provided jobs for almost
2,000 people in the town.

344
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,520
And DuPont's presence was felt everywhere.

345
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,040
- I have been a resident of
Parkersburg for 48 years.

346
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
I do not work for the DuPont company,

347
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
but I have seen how their
people have done much

348
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,840
for the cultural growth of this community.

349
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,680
- There are facilities for
tennis, camping, swimming,

350
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,120
softball, and more than 20
areas equipped for cookouts

351
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,000
and family picnics.

352
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,960
- DuPont took care of the community.

353
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,240
So when the town folk got word

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
that Earl Tennant hired
a lawyer to investigate,

355
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
they shunned him and his family.

356
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
As his sister-in-law put it,
we'd walk into a restaurant

357
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
and everybody in the restaurant
would get up and leave.

358
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,880
But Earl wasn't scared
off, and neither was Rob.

359
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,640
- I thought this was gonna
be pretty straightforward.

360
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,760
- See, the US Environmental
Protection Agency, the EPA,

361
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,080
dictates exactly which chemicals are safe

362
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,160
to be disposed of in a
landfill and in what amounts.

363
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,600
- We would get those records and permits,

364
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,840
and it would tell us which chemical

365
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,680
was causing this problem.

366
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,000
But none of those records
were really showing anything

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that was really causing a problem,

368
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
you know, nothing that would
explain that white foam.

369
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,200
- Whatever was in Earl's
water wasn't on the permits.

370
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Now, already in the 1950s,
people knew that Teflon,

371
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,960
specifically PTFE, was pretty safe.

372
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,440
It's a long and extremely inert molecule.

373
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,560
So if you ingest it, your
body just flushes it out.

374
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,600
However, if you heat Teflon
to 350 degrees Celsius,

375
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
it starts releasing fumes
that make people sick.

376
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,520
This often happened to
workers in Teflon plants.

377
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,400
Stray PTFE powder would
fall onto their cigarettes

378
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,440
as they were working,

379
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
and then later they would
accidentally smoke one

380
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
of these cigarettes.

381
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
Luckily, the symptoms were mild:

382
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,080
fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches,

383
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,800
and they would usually
pass within 48 hours.

384
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,840
It was called polymer fume fever.

385
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
And even though it rarely happens today,

386
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
it's why you should never
overheat your Teflon pan

387
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,520
to these temperatures,

388
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,680
especially if you have pet birds at home,

389
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,440
because the fumes are
much more toxic to them.

390
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,560
But Teflon couldn't have
poisoned Earl's cows.

391
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,720
There were no fumes or high temperatures,

392
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
so there must have been
something else in the water.

393
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
Rob filed a legal request

394
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
for all of the Washington
Works operational records,

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,720
and DuPont sent them over,

396
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,320
more than 60,000 documents.

397
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,240
- A lot of folks would try to say,

398
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
"Okay, you you want a lot of documents,

399
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
we'll give you a of documents"

400
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
and hope that there'd be no way
somebody could actually wade

401
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
through all of these files
and all of these materials.

402
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,240
But I am the kind of
person that I do dig in,

403
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,400
and I do want to go
through those documents,

404
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
so I actually did read all of that.

405
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,760
- And in those files,

406
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,280
a certain chemical kept
popping up everywhere,

407
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,200
C8.

408
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,240
- I never saw the kinds
of things I was seeing now

409
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,660
in these documents from DuPont.

410
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:17,678
(foreboding music)

411
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:21,680
- In 1961, the same year
Teflon pans hit the US market,

412
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,600
DuPont's in-house scientists
tested C8 on rats.

413
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,240
Ingesting as little as 1.5 milligrams

414
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
of C8 per kilogram of body
weight caused the rat's livers

415
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
to grow abnormally.

416
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
And a dose of 570 milligrams
per kilogram was lethal.

417
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
For reference, sodium cyanide,

418
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
one of the most dangerous
poisons, is lethal to rats

419
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,440
in doses of five to 15
milligrams per kilogram.

420
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
But even though C8 was less fatal,

421
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
it was concerning for two other reasons.

422
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
First, like Teflon,

423
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
its tail is made of carbon-fluorine bonds,

424
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
which makes it incredibly stable.

425
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,720
So C8 wouldn't break down in
the environment for decades.

426
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,680
And second, C8 looks like the fatty acids

427
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
that humans and animals
need for normal functioning,

428
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
just with fluorines instead of hydrogens.

429
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,840
So the concern was that C8
could get into the bloodstream,

430
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,040
hitch a ride on the proteins

431
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,880
that transport fatty acids around,

432
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
and get almost anywhere in the body.

433
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,680
And because of the carbon-fluorine bonds,

434
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,360
humans and animals have
no way to break down C8,

435
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,960
so it could slowly build up,
mimicking those fatty acids

436
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
and potentially disrupting
the systems they regulate,

437
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
like the liver.

438
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,320
- Toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative.

439
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,520
So the concern was it's
like a ticking time bomb.

440
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
It's got more opportunity to cause harm.

441
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,960
- As a safety measure, that
same rat study suggested

442
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
that all these materials should
be handled with extreme care

443
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,200
and that contact with skin
should be strictly avoided.

444
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
In 1962, DuPont redid the study

445
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
and confirmed that high
doses of C8 kill rats

446
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
through injury to the stomach, intestine,

447
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
brain, lungs, and pancreas.

448
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,640
Then in 1965, they found those
same toxic effects in dogs.

449
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,924
The evidence was mounting.

450
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:12,958
(suspenseful music)
(camera clicks)

451
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,640
- They were even studying monkeys.

452
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Some of the monkeys were dropping dead.

453
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,960
These chemicals were causing toxic effects

454
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,440
in multiple organ systems
in multiple species.

455
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
All these studies weren't being shared

456
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,240
with the scientific community.

457
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,280
- And likely no one outside

458
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
of DuPont would've noticed
something was wrong

459
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
if it was not for...

460
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,440
- Tooth decay, the most
widespread of all diseases.

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,920
- In the 1950s, tooth decay
was a nationwide problem.

462
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,720
So the US started adding
inorganic fluorides

463
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,520
like sodium fluoride to
the public water supply.

464
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
This helped fight cavities.

465
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,400
- 16 years after fluoridation,

466
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,080
all children will have
65% less tooth decay.

467
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,240
- In 1975, researchers wanted to know

468
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,440
if that inorganic fluoride was
getting into people's blood.

469
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
So they sampled blood from around the US,

470
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
and the results were as expected.

471
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,040
More fluoride in the tap
water meant more fluoride

472
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
in the blood.

473
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,600
But they found another type
of fluorine in the blood too,

474
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
which was organic fluorine,

475
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,560
carbon-fluorine bonds, and it
didn't follow the same trend.

476
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,240
- Well, these researchers were wondering,

477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
where's this coming from?

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,520
Because this is not a
naturally occurring substance.

479
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,560
And they did research,

480
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,440
and they found that 3M was
making these organic fluorides,

481
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,880
things like PFOA.

482
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,840
All right, so they approached
3M in 1975, asking them,

483
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
"Hey, we found this stuff

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
in the general US population's blood.

485
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
You know, could it be yours?"

486
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
And 3M pled ignorance.

487
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
- But just three months later,

488
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,040
3M compared the spectrum of
organic fluorine from the study

489
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,440
to their own chemicals, and

490
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
it was a match.

491
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Their chemicals were
getting into the blood

492
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
of people all across the United States,

493
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,720
but they didn't tell the researchers.

494
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,800
3M and DuPont were worried,

495
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,040
so they checked their own workers' blood,

496
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,480
and they found that they too
were contaminated with C8

497
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,480
at levels 1,000 times higher
than those in the study.

498
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
And when DuPont checked
their medical records,

499
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,800
many of these workers were
showing signs of liver disease.

500
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,720
Meanwhile, DuPont was
dumping almost 10 tons of C8

501
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,040
into the Ohio River each year,

502
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,600
and they were piling
up thousands more tons

503
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,680
as C8 sludge that would leach

504
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,400
from the landfill next to Earl's farm,

505
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
all while showing commercials like these.

506
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
- And the water that
eventually flows to the river

507
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
is collected at five points and analyzed

508
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,240
to make sure we don't pollute the Ohio.

509
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
- And by the early '80s,

510
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,160
the first cancer study is done in rats,

511
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,080
and it confirms PFOA causes,

512
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
not just might be linked with,

513
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,440
but causes testicular tumors, all right?

514
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
That sends alarm bells
off within the company

515
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
because the concern is, of course,

516
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,120
we're putting this in the air,
we're putting in the water.

517
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,240
It's in Teflon.

518
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
- DuPont collected samples
around Washington Works,

519
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
and C8 wasn't just in the river,

520
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,520
it was in the public water supply.

521
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,040
So in 1984, DuPont officials met

522
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,280
to assess whether C8 should be swapped

523
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
for a safer chemical.

524
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,680
But their conclusion
was that currently none

525
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,200
of the options developed are,

526
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
from a fine powder business standpoint,

527
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,920
economically attractive,
so C8 stuck around,

528
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
and DuPont just came up with a
safe dose for drinking water.

529
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,960
- DuPont scientists are the
first people on the planet

530
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,840
to say what would be a
safe level for humans.

531
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,400
They calculated something
like 0.6 parts per billion,

532
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
which they rounded up to one.

533
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,560
And the importance of
that is, at that time,

534
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,720
that was about the lowest level
you could detect in water.

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,080
Essentially, if we can
detect it, it's too high.

536
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
- So to put that into perspective,

537
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
here is one 2,500-liter tank of water.

538
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,680
It filled to the brim.

539
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,840
Now, imagine you take one drop
of PFOA, 0.05 milliliters,

540
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
and you place it not in one of these tanks

541
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
or two or three,

542
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
20 of these tanks.

543
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
That's one part per billion,

544
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,480
and that's the number DuPont thought

545
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
would be unsafe for humans to drink.

546
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,120
- And after determining
its own safety metric,

547
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,680
DuPont tested the landfill
wastewater leaching

548
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,040
into Earl's creek.

549
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,840
It came back at 1,600 parts per billion.

550
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,960
- They didn't tell anybody.

551
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,760
So at that point, I
thought I had figured out

552
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,840
what had finally happened to the cows.

553
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,240
- Rob compiled all the
evidence into a 900-page letter

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,960
and sent it to the EPA,
the Department of Justice,

555
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,000
and even the US Attorney General.

556
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
And just a few months later,

557
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
DuPont settled with Earl Tennant

558
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
and his family for an undisclosed sum,

559
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,440
although they didn't
admit to any wrongdoing.

560
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,720
- But this stuff wasn't just

561
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,120
in the water the cows were drinking.

562
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,160
This was in

563
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,280
the surrounding communities'
public wells, right?

564
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
People around Mr. Tennant,

565
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,320
the tens of thousands of people

566
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
in that community had
likely been drinking this

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,360
for decades and didn't know.

568
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,960
- So Rob sued DuPont again,

569
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
now on behalf of the 70,000
people around Parkersburg

570
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,680
who were unwittingly exposed to C8.

571
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,360
And it wasn't just
Parkersburg or West Virginia.

572
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
In the year 2000, researchers
analyzed blood samples

573
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,440
from thousands of Americans
all across the country,

574
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,320
and 100% of those samples
came back positive for C8

575
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,920
at an average of five parts per billion.

576
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,600
But if virtually everyone
in the US is contaminated,

577
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,560
how harmful could C8 really be?

578
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
This is exactly what Rob had to find out

579
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,960
to have a fighting chance against DuPont.

580
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
So in 2005, he spearheaded a medical study

581
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,800
of everyone around Washington Works.

582
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
- Scientists need to know

583
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,800
if the chemical C8 causes
any health problems.

584
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
By completing a health questionnaire

585
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
and having your blood
tested, you can help.

586
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,000
- Analyzing the blood samples

587
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,200
and medical records took seven long years,

588
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
and many in Parkersburg passed away

589
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,960
before a verdict was even reached,

590
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,560
including Earl and his wife Sandra.

591
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,640
But finally, in 2013,

592
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,680
an independent science
panel had the results.

593
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,160
They confirmed a probable link between C8

594
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,840
and six human diseases,
including thyroid disease,

595
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,800
testicular cancer, and kidney cancer.

596
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,080
And these findings were based
solely on the nearby community

597
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,000
with an average C8 blood
level of 28 parts per billion.

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,520
So for example, an American
male has around a 1 in 43 chance

599
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
of developing kidney cancer.

600
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
It's around 1 in 73 for females,

601
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
but a person with more
than 30 parts per billion

602
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,280
of C8 in their blood serum

603
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
might have about double the odds,

604
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,320
so roughly 1 in 22 for males
and 1 in 37 for females.

605
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
But the data in many

606
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
of these studies only included survivors,

607
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
not people who might have
already died from C8 exposure.

608
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,920
So the verdict was

609
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,280
that the findings must be
interpreted with caution.

610
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,720
The true risk of C8 might be even higher.

611
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,720
Luckily, once these studies
were published in 2013,

612
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
DuPont was pressured by the
regulators to phase out C8.

613
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,480
And by 2017, they had to
pay out over $600 million

614
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,280
to victims of C8 exposure,

615
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,040
which is a pretty small price to pay

616
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,280
for a company that made almost $80 billion

617
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,000
in sales just that year.

618
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And all throughout, DuPont
denied any wrongdoing,

619
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but that wasn't the end of it
for Parkersburg or anyone else

620
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,280
because DuPont separated
its entire Teflon business

621
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
into a spinoff company, Chemours,

622
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,360
that agreed to use a different chemical.

623
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,520
So what was it?

624
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,880
- They simply took C8 and
knocked two carbons off

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,760
and started making C6.

626
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,400
- They called it GenX.

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,480
Because it was shorter

628
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,360
and had an oxygen atom
interrupting the carbon chain,

629
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
it was expected to be more degradable.

630
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
So Chemours claimed a dose as
high as 70 parts per billion

631
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,880
of GenX in drinking water
would still be safe.

632
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,920
- That chemical gets shipped

633
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,240
to the same plant in West Virginia.

634
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
So now GenX goes into the air.

635
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
GenX goes into the Ohio River.

636
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,440
GenX is found in public water supplies.

637
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,640
So GenX is allowed to
come out into the world,

638
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,560
be used in Teflon.

639
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Then the cancer study is done,

640
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,040
which shows GenX causes
the exact same three tumors

641
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,520
in rats that PFOA did:

642
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,680
liver, testicular, and pancreatic.

643
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,600
- And the fact that its chain

644
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,320
is shorter also makes GenX more mobile,

645
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,280
so it could contaminate larger areas.

646
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,240
The truth is we just don't
know enough about it,

647
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,960
and that's exactly the problem.

648
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,720
- It took us decades to get to the point

649
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
of finally addressing C8.

650
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
They simply tweak it a bit,
change the chemical name.

651
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,360
All of the science and all
of the concern, that's on C8.

652
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,480
This is C6 or C9 or C4.

653
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,800
You don't have enough evidence

654
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,720
that these other ones are bad.

655
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
This is Whac-A-Mole.

656
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,840
We get to the point we're addressing one

657
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
and the new one pops up

658
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,600
and we're told we have to start over.

659
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,200
- And it isn't just C8 or GenX.

660
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
They belong to a family

661
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,960
of over 14,000 different
manmade chemicals,

662
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
all covered in carbon-fluorine bonds.

663
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,840
And companies can make
them however they want,

664
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,840
C7s, C9s, branched, polymers, acids.

665
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,680
The generic term for all of
these substances is PFAS,

666
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,880
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,

667
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
and like Teflon, they have
almost magical qualities.

668
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,840
They repel liquids,

669
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
so PFAS are used to make
clothing waterproof.

670
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,400
They're also grease-resistant,

671
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
so we coat things like fast food wrappers

672
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,160
and microwave popcorn bags
in PFAS to prevent stains.

673
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,040
Waterproof lipstick and
mascara, hygiene products,

674
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,680
and even contact lenses have PFAS in.

675
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Even the screen you're watching this on,

676
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,520
likely has a PFAS anti-smudge coating.

677
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,880
(brooding music)

678
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,520
The trouble is that the
same carbon-fluorine bonds

679
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
that make PFAS so stable

680
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
and useful in consumer products

681
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,040
also make them incredibly
persistent in the environment.

682
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,960
Which is why you might also know PFAS

683
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,160
under a different name, forever chemicals.

684
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,520
They have been found
everywhere from bustling cities

685
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
to untouched areas of wilderness.

686
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,960
Every continent, including
Antarctica, has PFAS all over it.

687
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
- Almost every living creature

688
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,640
from polar bears to birds to fish,

689
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,680
I mean, this stuff is
being found everywhere.

690
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,800
So massive worldwide contamination,

691
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,720
but by completely manmade chemicals

692
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,920
that are fingerprints back to
just a couple of companies.

693
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,200
- Even though companies knew

694
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,680
how dangerous these
chemicals were 50 years ago,

695
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,960
they decided not to inform
the public and the regulators.

696
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,400
So we're only finding out

697
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,880
about this global contamination now.

698
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
And there've been many cases

699
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,240
where important public health information

700
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,040
doesn't get widely disseminated for years.

701
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
And whenever that happens,

702
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,400
media coverage can be inconsistent,

703
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,960
which is why I've partnered
up with Ground News

704
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
as the sponsor of this video.

705
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
Their platform reveals how
stories like these are covered

706
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
across the media landscape.

707
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
For example, a recent study suggested

708
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
that 23 million Americans

709
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,560
were exposed to forever
chemicals through wastewater,

710
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,640
but you probably haven't seen the story

711
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,600
since fewer than 40
outlets even published it.

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
And take a look at how different some

713
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
of these headlines are.

714
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
With Ground News,

715
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,320
you can also see that
government-funded sources

716
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,640
had limited reporting of this story,

717
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,080
and only 9% of the publications
were right-leaning.

718
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
So Ground News flagged this
as a potential blind spot.

719
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,680
It's highlighted on their blind-spot feed

720
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,720
where you can see stories

721
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,320
that are disproportionately covered

722
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
by one side of the political spectrum.

723
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,920
The whole point of
Veritasium is to make videos

724
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,040
that get to the truth,

725
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,800
whether that's explaining misconceptions

726
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,240
or getting to the bottom of
potentially dangerous chemicals.

727
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Ground News helps us do that,
and they can help you too.

728
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,400
So if you, like us, care
about getting to the truth,

729
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,240
go to ground.news/ve or scan this QR code.

730
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
Our link gets you 40%
off their vantage plan.

731
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,480
And now back to PFAS.

732
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,920
(quirky music)

733
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,120
Okay, now I wanna find out how much

734
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
of these chemicals is
actually in my blood.

735
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,520
So I have a little test here. (groans)

736
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,320
I hate the idea of drawing
my own blood. (groans)

737
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,720
Okay, that was pretty easy, actually.

738
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
I was really worried

739
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,480
that there was not gonna
be enough blood coming out.

740
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,400
But there was plenty.

741
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,440
(sighs) So the question is,

742
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,360
how much of these dangerous
chemicals are in my blood?

743
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,880
- Has anyone ever come back with blood

744
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,720
that has zero PFAS whatsoever?

745
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,400
- I've been doing blood
testing on PFAS since 2007,

746
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,200
and I've never seen a non-detect.

747
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
- No way.
- So I hear that 98%

748
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
of the population has PFAS in their blood,

749
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,680
but I'm looking for that 2% that doesn't

750
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,320
because I've yet to see them.

751
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,440
- That's incredible, I mean very,

752
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
very bad incredible, but wow.

753
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
- But if everyone on
Earth has trace amounts

754
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,040
of these chemicals in their blood,

755
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,200
how much harm could they really be doing?

756
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,880
- I wanna make a distinction

757
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,160
because it turns out not all
PFAS are equally dangerous.

758
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
You can kind of split
them up into two groups.

759
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,320
First up, you have long, repeating chains

760
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
of carbon-fluorine bonds

761
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
that are tens or hundreds
of thousands of atoms long,

762
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
so stuff like Teflon.

763
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
These are so big and inert that
even if you do ingest them,

764
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,560
your body's just gonna flush them out.

765
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,400
They can't be absorbed
into your bloodstream,

766
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,320
so you're pretty safe.

767
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,680
They're called fluoropolymers

768
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,280
because of the long repeating chains

769
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,880
of carbon and fluorine bonds.

770
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
But the catch is to make
these fluoropolymers,

771
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,840
stuff like Teflon, you need
to use processing aids,

772
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,600
things like PFOA or GenX,
and those are the nasty ones.

773
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,840
These molecules are 5 to 10 carbons long,

774
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
which makes them small enough

775
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,760
to actually enter the bloodstream.

776
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,200
They have functional groups at the ends

777
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,480
that are usually acids.

778
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,920
The most common ones are
perfluoroalkyl acids,

779
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,160
which means that they can bind
to the proteins in your blood

780
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,960
and be transported anywhere in the body.

781
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,360
So they slowly accumulate
and build up over time.

782
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,440
Now, there are more than
just two groups of PFAS

783
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,800
and even different definitions
of what PFAS even are,

784
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,640
but most of what we know really relates

785
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,280
to just a handful of chemicals
from this group here,

786
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,160
to these perfluoroalkyl acids.

787
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,084
(wondrous music)

788
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:52,240
- Perhaps the most comprehensive
document on PFAS toxicity

789
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,080
was published in 2022

790
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,480
by the National Academies of Sciences,

791
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,080
Engineering, and Medicine.

792
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,400
And it looked at only
seven perfluoroalkyl acids.

793
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,880
These are sister chemicals to PFOA.

794
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,560
And some of them, like PFOS and PFHxS,

795
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,880
were used heavily in
the production of stain

796
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
and water-resistant products
like 3M's Scotchgard

797
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,960
before they too got phased
out due to toxicity concerns.

798
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,040
The report surmised that if the sum

799
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,800
of these seven acids in your blood

800
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,120
is below two parts per billion,
there shouldn't be any harm.

801
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,760
If your level is between 2
and 20 parts per billion,

802
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,400
there's a potential for
harmful health effects.

803
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
Although the exact mechanism

804
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,600
by which PFAS cause harm
isn't fully understood,

805
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,480
exposure has most
consistently been associated

806
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,280
with high cholesterol, a
decreased immune system response

807
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
to vaccines and infections, kidney cancer,

808
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,560
and decreased growth in infants.

809
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
But PFAS have also been linked

810
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
to dozens of other conditions,

811
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,680
and above 20 parts per billion,
the risk is even greater.

812
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
So where do I fall on this graph?

813
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,400
- Right, so I have your results here.

814
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,840
- You're not gonna tell me what yours were

815
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,120
before I see mine?

816
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,320
- No.

817
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,600
- All right.

818
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,760
- You're positive for PFOA.

819
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
- Okay.

820
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,120
- The level for PFOA for
a US person went down

821
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,440
from five parts per
billion around the 2000s

822
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
to around 1.46, what you have.

823
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,400
So you're super average for a US person.

824
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,640
- Great. Okay.

825
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
- The good news is though,
no GenX for you or for me,

826
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,760
which is great.

827
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,520
- All right, let's go.

828
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,760
- But the real surprise, I ,guess is PFOS,

829
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,080
the sister chemical, and it
was used in a similar way,

830
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
so stain-resistant
carpets, treated clothing,

831
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,520
and your result is at
8.93 parts per billion,

832
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,760
whereas the US average is 4.3.

833
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,160
-Yeah.

834
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,360
- That's crazy.

835
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,640
- Yeah, it is crazy

836
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,600
'cause it was discontinued
pretty much in 2002.

837
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,920
- This is not the results I expected.

838
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,760
I honestly expected very boring results

839
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,640
of, like, yeah, you're
around the middle of the pack

840
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
or a little bit on the low side.

841
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
- And then for PFHxS,

842
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,760
basically PFOS but six
instead of eight carbons,

843
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,560
your levels here are almost
seven parts per billion,

844
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,960
but the US average average
is one part per billion.

845
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
You're higher than 95% of Americans.

846
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,960
- It just, like, it shocks me

847
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,400
'cause, like, I was fully walking

848
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,080
into this meeting expecting to be,

849
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,360
you know, roughly average.

850
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,880
- Yeah, to me, it's scary.

851
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
You know, you live in
a normal life thinking

852
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,400
that you're taking care of everything,

853
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,520
and then you have high levels

854
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,960
of a chemical you never heard of.

855
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,560
- The combined sum of all
the PFAS detected in my blood

856
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,840
was 17.92 parts per billion,

857
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,480
more than double the US median.

858
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
I'm just below the level

859
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,960
where the National Academies
recommend additional screenings

860
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,840
for PFAS-related diseases.

861
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,880
I had no idea I would come
back with such elevated levels.

862
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
I'd love to get the
level, sort of, down a bit

863
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
to a level where I feel
like it's more in line

864
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,280
with the general population.

865
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,200
- Yeah.

866
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,920
- But, like, where could
this have come from?

867
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,840
There are three main ways we get exposed

868
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,200
to forever chemicals,

869
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,280
and the one you'll hear
the most about in the media

870
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,960
is likely PFAS-containing products.

871
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,480
- Shampoo, dental floss,
paints, varnishes.

872
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,080
- Potentially dangerous chemicals.

873
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,320
- Dangerous chemicals, toxic chemicals.

874
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
- People are throwing out
their non-stick cookware.

875
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,800
- My wife threw out all our
non-stick pans over a year ago,

876
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,040
and since then, we've been
using stainless steel.

877
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,720
She is very good at making it
not stick. Me, not so much.

878
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
But are pans really the problem?

879
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,680
The actual coating on the pan is Teflon,

880
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,000
which, again, is just a long, inert chain

881
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,760
of carbon-fluorine bonds.

882
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
So even if you ingest it, it
doesn't react with your body.

883
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,840
If you have a pan like that at home,

884
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,160
you probably don't need to throw it out.

885
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,840
The same goes for most other
PFAS-containing products.

886
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,240
Waterproof clothing,
stain-resistant furniture,

887
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
and sweat-proof watchbands

888
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
might all release some level of PFAS,

889
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,440
but the risk of direct exposure
through skin is likely low.

890
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,160
So the bigger problem is how easily PFAS

891
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,040
from these products can
end up in the environment.

892
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,320
And many of the factories

893
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
that make these products
don't have a good track record

894
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,240
of keeping the chemicals contained.

895
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,280
- People don't understand
that the stories that you see,

896
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,560
for example, what was happening

897
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,120
in the community in West Virginia,

898
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,840
this is the same chemical
and the same things

899
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,360
that we're seeing play
out now in Australia

900
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,440
and in Japan, in Italy,
in Germany, in the UK.

901
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
I mean, there are a lot of folks

902
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,520
that are still not grasping the fact

903
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,960
that these are the same chemicals.

904
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,840
- Our second main source
of exposure is food.

905
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,040
A lot of it comes packaged
in PFAS-treated materials,

906
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,160
like takeout boxes,
microwave popcorn bags,

907
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
and burger wrappers.

908
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
It's on a burger wrapper.

909
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,680
Is it a tiny amount? Is it
a ridiculously tiny amount?

910
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,120
- We actually did tests at the lab

911
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,440
with stuff that usually contains PFAS.

912
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,240
So microwave popcorn, fast food wrappers,

913
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
paper cups that are waterproof.

914
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,800
So I have tap water here
from a house in London.

915
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,160
Could we boil some water?

916
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
Because usually you
interact with these products

917
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,000
when they're hot and then see
if any of the PFAS leaches off

918
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,040
and you potentially
eat them or drink them.

919
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,840
- This is citizen science, right?

920
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,680
So it's, like, there might be some error,

921
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,520
but with a solid control

922
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,240
and then with the same tap
water going to all of them,

923
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,640
we can at least get something, yeah.

924
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,120
- Yeah, and even if we get nothing,

925
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,720
we'll know that people are probably safe

926
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,760
using these products.

927
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,560
All right.
- Whisk it around.

928
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,000
- Yeah, really get that PFAS

929
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,727
in that water, right.
- The juices going.

930
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:31,740
- And get the

931
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,320
PFAS juices going.
- Well, it's supposed

932
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,951
to be safe for human consumption.

933
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:35,880
- Yeah.
- That's the wild thing.

934
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,360
- We sloshed it around there,

935
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,760
hot water, boiling water
for around 30 seconds,

936
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,160
and then we tested that water
to see if any of the PFAS

937
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,280
that are used to coat these items

938
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,880
would actually make it into the water.

939
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,840
So here's what I got.

940
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,680
And these are parts per trillion now.

941
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,160
So for PFOA, good news.

942
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,320
Basically no detection anywhere

943
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,760
except for the microwave popcorn.

944
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
I will say these are very low
levels, but hold your horses

945
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
'cause microwave popcorn gets worse.

946
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,360
- The thing about microwave popcorn,

947
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,400
it's sitting in there
wrapped up with the popcorn

948
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,240
for months or years

949
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,400
before you ever stick
it in your microwave.

950
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,960
That gives those chemicals plenty of time

951
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,360
to, like, leach into the oils,

952
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,720
and it's gonna go all over the popcorn,

953
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
and you're gonna eat it.

954
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,400
This could explain some
of our own results.

955
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,320
The level for PFPeA,

956
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,960
which is a shorter variation of PFOA,

957
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,880
came back at 10 parts per trillion

958
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,440
after the popcorn bag test.

959
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,880
And you can see similar results

960
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,120
in some of the other PFAS species.

961
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,080
- But then microwave popcorn
actually drops for PFOS.

962
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,960
Why could that be? We don't actually know.

963
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,080
- I was gonna say maybe the PFOS, like,

964
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,320
went on that wrapper and found its friends

965
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,800
and just hung out there.

966
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
- Yeah, could be.

967
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,040
I know we've only done,
like, one test here.

968
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,320
No repeat measurements, so we
can't conclude much from this,

969
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,080
but there's something to be said

970
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,320
for when you're using these products,

971
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,400
they're gonna leach into your
water and leach into your food

972
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
- And research tends to agree.

973
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,240
A 2019 study found that eating fast food

974
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,000
and microwave popcorn especially
can increase your PFAS load

975
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,640
while eating homecooked meals doesn't.

976
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
But even something as simple
as reheating your food

977
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
on a plate instead of in
the original packaging

978
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,360
could prevent PFAS from
migrating to your food.

979
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,240
Now, you might expect

980
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,560
that these part per
trillion levels we detected

981
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,720
in the London tap water
are nothing compared

982
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,400
to the parts per billion
you'd find in human blood,

983
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,920
but the surprising thing is that

984
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,200
to have two parts per billion
of PFOA in your blood,

985
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,640
you don't need to drink water

986
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
with two parts per billion of PFOA in it

987
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,760
because PFAS accumulate
in your body over time.

988
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,720
So even water with as little
as four parts per trillion

989
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,400
of PFOA combined with other
exposure can be enough

990
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,600
to maintain your blood levels this high.

991
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,920
And this is why, in addition to food,

992
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,720
water is your biggest source of exposure.

993
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,840
This is especially true if
you live near a PFAS factory

994
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,200
where the local water is
often heavily contaminated.

995
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,120
But the same goes for areas
near military bases or airports.

996
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,840
See, adding chemicals like PFOA

997
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,200
or PFOS to water lowers
its surface tension

998
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,680
so the water gets more slippery,

999
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,400
and these chemicals also tend to foam up.

1000
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,320
So they make for an excellent ingredient

1001
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,040
in firefighting foams,
they spread quicker,

1002
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,800
and the foam blocks access
to oxygen extremely well.

1003
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,320
And since both military bases

1004
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,360
and airports frequently do
fire drills with these foams,

1005
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
they end up seeping

1006
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,120
into the surrounding soil and groundwater.

1007
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,800
But it doesn't stop there.

1008
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
- Currently, we have reached
planetary saturation levels

1009
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,560
for PFAS, which means that
when you look up at that cloud

1010
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,280
and it rains, it rains unsafe levels

1011
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
of at least four PFAS species.

1012
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,320
- It turns out that our entire water cycle

1013
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,720
is contaminated with PFAS.

1014
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,920
So even when it rains
on the Tibetan Plateau,

1015
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,960
that rain contains PFAS.

1016
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
To check the water levels in your area,

1017
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,160
you can use these maps

1018
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,040
that show PFAS
contamination across the US,

1019
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
Europe, and Australia.

1020
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,920
What about Los Angeles, Encino?

1021
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,040
That's where I spent, like,
7 of the last 10 years.

1022
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,000
- Crescenta Valley.

1023
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,040
- Those are all high.

1024
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,760
- Yeah.

1025
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,240
- Santa Clarita, some.
PFHxS level is crazy.

1026
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,280
So maybe you're getting your
water from Santa Clarita.

1027
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,160
- Wow.

1028
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,600
- There's a calculator.

1029
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,320
It could give you what an
estimate in your blood serum is.

1030
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,640
What we can try to do now is
put that up in the calculator,

1031
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,080
see if you get something close

1032
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,440
to what you have, if you want.

1033
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,200
- Sure.

1034
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,680
- PFHxS, so typical value for an adult

1035
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
is one part per billion,

1036
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,120
and then the Santa Clarita water

1037
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,800
is around 37 parts per trillion.

1038
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
- If you look after, like, 10 years.

1039
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,920
- So after roughly 10 years of exposure,

1040
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,160
you would have to have 6.85
parts per billion in your blood.

1041
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,000
And then I can tell you
that you are at 6.84.

1042
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,440
- That would explain things.

1043
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,880
Now, I can't say for sure

1044
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,120
where my drinking water was coming from,

1045
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,000
but if I was consistently
drinking water contaminated

1046
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,080
at similar levels, then that
would explain my results.

1047
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,160
But if you are worried
about your own water,

1048
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,080
you should contact your provider directly

1049
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,880
for the most relevant information.

1050
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,080
It's concerning just

1051
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,120
how unregulated drinking water has been.

1052
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,680
It was actually only a
year ago in April 2024

1053
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,400
that the US EPA finally set legal limits

1054
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,640
for PFAS in drinking water.

1055
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,960
The safe level for PFOA went down

1056
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,440
from DuPont's initial one part per billion

1057
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,280
to four parts per trillion.

1058
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,000
- So we're no longer talking
about one drop of PFOA

1059
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,520
in 20 of these tanks,

1060
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,320
we're talking about one drop in 5,000.

1061
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,840
That's five Olympic-sized swimming pools.

1062
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,800
And if there's even a
drop of PFOA in there,

1063
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,480
the EPA is concerned.

1064
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,280
- The same four parts per trillion limit

1065
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,240
was also set for PFOS,
the sister chemical.

1066
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,360
And GenX went down

1067
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,920
from the 70,000 parts per
trillion initially proposed

1068
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,160
by Chemours to just 10.

1069
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,960
The same goes for PFHxS.

1070
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,600
For reference, the EPA's
limit for lead in water

1071
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,840
is 10,000 parts per trillion,

1072
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,480
and for cyanide, 200,000,

1073
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,040
- It gives you a pretty clear indication

1074
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,720
of how concerned the
scientific community is.

1075
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,240
- And just when we got EPA limits,

1076
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,560
we got a new administration in the US,

1077
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,440
which might be reversing
some of the PFAS bans.

1078
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,600
So you can't always
depend on the regulators,

1079
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,000
and you seemingly can't
depend on the companies

1080
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,200
that make this stuff to
dispose of it safely.

1081
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,840
So what can you do?

1082
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,360
If your water is contaminated,

1083
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,600
you might want to consider
getting a PFAS-certified filter.

1084
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,320
Reverse osmosis, granulated active carbon,

1085
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,720
and ion exchange filters are all capable

1086
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,600
of removing PFAS out of drinking water.

1087
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,080
But the responsibility
to filter drinking water

1088
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,320
shouldn't come down to the individual.

1089
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,000
PFAS should be captured at the
source, during manufacturing,

1090
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,720
before they ever reach the environment.

1091
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
And some companies like Puraffinity

1092
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,760
are developing custom
filters to make that happen.

1093
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,180
- So very lab-looking lab.

1094
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,440
- Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

1095
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
So could you walk me through, like,

1096
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,760
what all these pipes do, and
what do you have in here?

1097
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,960
- So this water is representative

1098
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,600
of where you've had a big
firefighting foam incident.

1099
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,360
So you wanna filter this water,

1100
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,320
but basically, the concept
is take it from the top

1101
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,360
through the vessel.

1102
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,360
As it passes through this material,

1103
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,120
it basically sticks on

1104
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,360
to some of the PFAS chemicals in water,

1105
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,080
and then you run into
another part of treatment

1106
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,200
and a third one.

1107
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,720
- To me, it seems like if PFAS
are so, like, bioaccumulative

1108
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,800
and actually persistent and stable,

1109
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,080
they don't really react with things.

1110
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,440
So how do you force them to
react with stuff in here?

1111
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,960
- Basically, taking advantage
of this long organic tail

1112
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,400
as well as the polar head,

1113
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
and so you can have some
electrostatic interactions

1114
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,920
with the polar head,

1115
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,520
and then you can have some hydrophilic

1116
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,600
and hydrophobic
interactions with the tail.

1117
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,560
And by combining these
three binding mechanisms,

1118
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,640
you increase massively your
likelihood of binding PFAS,

1119
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,720
even if it's still difficult.

1120
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,880
- Right, do the levels
drop 100% already here,

1121
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,028
or do you see a gradual decrease in PFAS

1122
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:09,760
as you go?
- That's the cool question.

1123
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,120
- Okay.
- So in the beginning,

1124
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,040
it drops 100% after this one.

1125
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,840
- Oh, so problem solved, or?

1126
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,632
- Problem solved for the time being.

1127
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,000
- Okay. Okay.
- What we see right now

1128
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,320
is it will last about 40,000
volumes of this vessel.

1129
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,120
So a 10-liter vessel would
basically provides all

1130
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,840
of the PFAS treatment for a household.

1131
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,280
- In a year.
- For a year.

1132
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,160
- You want this to be in factories first,

1133
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,280
so it never gets into the water.

1134
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1135
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,040
- We are talking to the
fluorochemicals manufacturers,

1136
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
and they're really trying to,

1137
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,064
yeah, move forward rather than
just wait for regulations.

1138
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:42,078
(bright music)

1139
00:48:42,078 --> 00:48:45,040
- Everyone's true risk from
PFAS will be different.

1140
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,880
It depends on dozens of factors,

1141
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,520
like your water
contamination, your lifestyle,

1142
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,800
what you eat.

1143
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,680
But how much should you
really worry about it?

1144
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,400
Like, if I'm at 17 or
18 parts per billion,

1145
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
is that the equivalent of
drinking a beer a night

1146
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,800
or going out in the Australian
sun without sunscreen?

1147
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,040
- So what I like to do is
create this hierarchy of risk.

1148
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,800
And in terms of hierarchy
of risk reduction,

1149
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,520
number one on that is
stopping smoking, exercising,

1150
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,680
consuming a healthy, whole-food diet,

1151
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,480
and making sure you're getting
seven to nine hours of sleep.

1152
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
Then you have medium
levels of intervention,

1153
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,640
seeing your primary care doctor,

1154
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,240
controlling your cholesterol numbers.

1155
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,320
And then on the lower tier that you have,

1156
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,800
PFAS probably falls into that lower tier.

1157
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,680
- Being preventative about PFAS exposure

1158
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,520
is currently our only option

1159
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,080
because there are no approved
medical treatments available.

1160
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,800
However, if you compare PFAS contamination

1161
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,880
between the sexes, male levels
are consistently higher,

1162
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,440
at least up until around the age of 50

1163
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,760
when menopause usually starts.

1164
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,000
This is partly because
menstruation, birth,

1165
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and lactation are all ways
PFAS can escape the body.

1166
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,920
PFAS can pass through the placenta

1167
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,320
and into the fetus during pregnancy,

1168
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,280
and then the baby can also get
exposed through breast milk.

1169
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,840
- It's something that pregnant people

1170
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,000
should be extremely careful about.

1171
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,800
You know, young children
are incredibly susceptible.

1172
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,880
They're drinking more
water, they're growing,

1173
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,640
they're near surfaces
like treated carpets.

1174
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,480
- Now, not everyone has
to change their lifestyle

1175
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,240
because of PFAS, but if you
are in a high-risk group

1176
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,280
because of pregnancy

1177
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,280
or because you live or work
in a PFAS-contaminated area,

1178
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,320
you might want to consider it.

1179
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,600
(fire roaring)

1180
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,160
Firefighters have
especially high PFAS levels

1181
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,440
because their gear and
foams are laced with them.

1182
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,680
Remarkably, a 2022 study found

1183
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,760
that when firefighters donated blood

1184
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,680
or plasma frequently enough,

1185
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,600
they reduced their PFAS levels
by up to 30% within a year.

1186
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,840
- And it's kind of ironic that,

1187
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,640
you know, our health system's
coming back to bloodletting.

1188
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,160
- What do you think about
the idea of donating blood

1189
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,800
as a way to reduce PFAS in the body?

1190
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,120
- I've never heard of that as a strategy.

1191
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,480
That's kind of interesting.

1192
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,840
Well, I definitely recommend

1193
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,520
people donate blood more frequently,

1194
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,040
not because of PFAS exposure,

1195
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,400
but because of the fact
we desperately need blood.

1196
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,160
What's important to note is that,

1197
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,080
especially in this current administration,

1198
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,640
we need to be very careful
about shifting budgets away

1199
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,440
from research agencies
because without that research,

1200
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,720
the guidance that I'm giving

1201
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,280
is gonna be significantly more flawed.

1202
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,200
The reason I'm able to
talk about what we know

1203
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,120
and what we don't know
comes from that research.

1204
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
So if we're gonna be cutting the budgets

1205
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,520
to these major agencies
and letting scientists go,

1206
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,840
we're only gonna get worse
and worse information.

1207
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,400
- We are still a good few years away

1208
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,600
from proper medical treatment
and better PFAS regulations

1209
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,600
because this is extremely tricky.

1210
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,320
There are places where we
should ban PFAS completely,

1211
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,600
like hygiene products,
cosmetics, and food packaging,

1212
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,000
and some countries are already doing that.

1213
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,520
But we also can't ban PFAS
altogether, at least not yet,

1214
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,440
because we still rely on these chemicals

1215
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,520
for things like medical implants.

1216
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,920
And it's currently impossible
to make semiconductors

1217
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,960
for our electronics without them

1218
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,040
- All the tubing

1219
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,520
for the vaccine
manufacturing is PFAS-based.

1220
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,800
They take us to space as
well, our space suits.

1221
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
But even in these niche applications,

1222
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,200
we have to be responsible
around how we use it.

1223
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,320
- People are coming together

1224
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,160
from a lot of different disciplines

1225
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,640
to create destruction mechanisms,

1226
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,200
to create novel capture materials,

1227
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,440
and to create novel replacements.

1228
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,680
I am excited and inspired
by all of the great work

1229
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,960
that's going on around me.

1230
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,360
So I think if people want to learn more,

1231
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,520
I would advise them to
learn about the risk,

1232
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,920
but then also learn
about the new technology

1233
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,520
that's being developed

1234
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,000
that will hopefully put
us in the right direction.

1235
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,600
- So to me,

1236
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,680
you know, one of the most
important things we can do

1237
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,400
is have discussions like
what we're doing right here.

1238
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,600
If the story and the
information's out there,

1239
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,520
people can make informed choices

1240
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,320
about whether they want to
continue purchasing things

1241
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
that have these materials in them.

1242
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,880
And what we're seeing is
consumers, as they do become aware,

1243
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,840
are saying, "No, we don't
want these chemicals."

1244
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,880
And companies are
voluntarily coming forward

1245
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,360
and taking these chemicals out of products

1246
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,560
because the consumers
are now demanding it.

1247
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,640
- We've been here before
with leaded gasoline,

1248
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,240
Freon, and asbestos.

1249
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,160
And each time, we did the research

1250
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,440
and made the right decision
to phase these chemicals out.

1251
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,720
With PFAS, we're just starting
to understand the problem.

1252
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,720
But I'm hopeful we'll make
the same decision again.

1253
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,360
If you want to inform
yourself more about PFAS,

1254
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,040
we've attached all the sources we've used

1255
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,520
to make this video down
in the description.

1256
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,840
It's actually our longest episode ever,

1257
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,360
and we couldn't have made it

1258
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,840
without the help of our
sponsor, Ground News.

1259
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,360
So if you wanna be more informed

1260
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,760
about the issues around the
world that are affecting you

1261
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,360
and everyone else out there,

1262
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,720
