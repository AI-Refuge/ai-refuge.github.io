3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,620
well welcome to true news on Rick Wiles

4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:43,960
if space aliens landed in America and

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,320
visited Evangelical Protestant churches

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,670
and watch Christian television and

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,860
listen to Christian radio and read

8
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,650
Christian books

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,170
the Martians would think that millions

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,199
of Americans belong to something called

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,489
the rapture religion and that they

12
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,270
worship a god named Israel it would be

13
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,050
unlikely

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:10,180
the Martians would hear anything about

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,470
Jesus Christ the cross salvation

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:18,280
Holiness the glorious appearing and the

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:23,020
resurrection of the Dead and eternity in

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,229
New Jerusalem slowly over decades the

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,479
American evangelical Protestant faith

20
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:35,110
has been transformed into Babylonian

21
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,530
churchianity they departed the ancient

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:42,159
Christian faith and they started a new

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,780
religion they replace the Christian

24
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:50,200
cross with the occult Star of David

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,640
sadly millions of Americans don't even

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,950
realize that the true Christian faith

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,770
centered on Jesus Christ has been

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:05,469
swapped out for a fake faith centered on

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,579
Israel's land now it didn't happen

30
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,269
overnight

31
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,380
the deception has been underway for

32
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,170
decades

33
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,370
the growth of religious television radio

34
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:22,660
and publishing however greatly advanced

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,890
the propaganda how did we get to this

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:30,519
place in 2018 where millions of people

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,060
who go to church don't know the core

38
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:37,540
tenets of the Christian faith who

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:41,319
hoodwinked them into believing another

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,610
gospel Doc perc heart and I are going to

41
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,280
discuss

42
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:49,360
the origin of the rapture doctrine and

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,070
the blasphemous idolizing of the State

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,650
of Israel as a god doc I can't put it in

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:00,880
any other words that's what's happened

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,040
to Christianity in America and for 1,900

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,440
years Rick there was a historic idea of

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,420
what the end times would look like what

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,750
things would look like here in this day

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,890
and age based upon what the Apostles

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,260
taught and what the Church Fathers

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,260
taught and what was handed down over the

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,750
centuries but over the past really the

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,780
past 150 but it's specifically the past

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,870
100 years that we've seen this seismic

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,250
shift in the idea of endtime theology

57
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,550
and what we're going to talk about today

58
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,280
is how did this shift take place in

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,780
America because it's in America right

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,180
you can go around where you've been a

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,280
missionary you know that this doctrine

62
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,480
is not believed it's not even known in

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,540
most parts of the world

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,769
the only places where the rapture

65
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,920
doctrine and this idolizing of Israel is

66
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,739
known is where American television and

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,470
radio has gone or American missionaries

68
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:00,330
have gone and introduced the doctrine

69
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:03,340
into other countries but the churches in

70
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,049
Latin America in Europe and Asia in the

71
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,450
Middle East they don't know anything

72
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,519
about it and at the very root of all

73
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,410
this change we talk about in theology

74
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,600
here in the the last hundred fifty

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,730
hundred years Rick is adding new

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,769
revelation to the Word of God that's

77
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,750
right that's at the core of it adding

78
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,370
something to the word that isn't there

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,900
now that's exactly how this all came

80
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,479
about and we're gonna talk about the

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,280
origin of it you have to go back to the

82
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,160
1830s yes

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,740
Johnny nelson darby yes - in Great

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,610
Britain there was a sect called the

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:39,970
Plymouth Brethren and they were a very

86
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,740
radical sect John Nelson Darby was a I

87
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,790
guess he would describe him as a

88
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,280
disgruntled anglican cleric he actually

89
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,729
was pushed out of the yes first out of

90
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,280
the Anglican Communion he he became the

91
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,720
leader of the Plymouth Brethren and they

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,410
believed and this is why it's so

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,390
dangerous

94
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,640
the Plymouth Brethren and they're still

95
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,520
around today but not much of an

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,600
organization of a denomination but their

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,180
their doctrine took over the Protestant

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,980
churches of America but they believed

99
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,710
that God gave them revelation knowledge

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,180
about the last days that the Lord had

101
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,550
not given any other right people in at

102
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,680
that time eighteen hundred years right

103
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,900
of church history so once again it comes

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,260
back hey I've heard something I've got

105
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,270
something that no one else has got and

106
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,880
it's adding to the Word of God and that

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,500
was their deception they were hearing

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,040
their atlas and they were hearing voices

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,980
of demons that's really what it was they

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,340
were hearing the voices of demons

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,140
telling them here is new revelation from

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,360
the Word of God that nobody has ever

113
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,610
seen before we're and these were demons

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,670
speaking to them and they were believing

115
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,620
they it was God telling them things that

116
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,440
had been kept from the greatest

117
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,780
theologians of the of the church kept

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,230
from the apostles think about that yeah

119
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,800
they they were so arrogant as to believe

120
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:14,260
that they had knowledge that God didn't

121
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,810
even give the apostles West sounds

122
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,850
familiar even today so same stuff going

123
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,010
on today that's right and I don't know

124
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:25,470
if you know this not but inside the

125
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,190
Plymouth Brethren there was a super

126
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,480
radical sect

127
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:33,540
all right called the exclusive Brethren

128
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,370
okay all right hey so they were even

129
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,440
more privileged than the regular brother

130
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,570
not first I've heard of that yes Oh John

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,540
Nelson Darby was the founder of the

132
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,370
exclusive brother inkay all right he had

133
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,030
even more knowledge than the rest of

134
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:52,570
them and so they came up with this over

135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,060
time they came up with us this doctrine

136
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,900
of dispensationalism that God was

137
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,940
dealing with humanity in dispensations

138
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,970
nobody had ever taught this nonsense

139
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,729
right they dreamed a stuff up and they

140
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,190
began to teach it and do you know who

141
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,040
their biggest critic was and in Great

142
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,760
Britain

143
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,070
at that time who it was a pastor named

144
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,140
Charles Spurgeon oh just some

145
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,660
run-of-the-mill pastor yeah yeah the

146
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,460
Reformed Baptist pastor now how would

147
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,810
you like to get called down from the

148
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,150
pulpit of Charles Spurgeon but Charles

149
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,570
Spurgeon was denouncing the Plymouth

150
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,210
Brethren as a dangerous radical sect and

151
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,700
he was warning the Christians of London

152
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:41,650
stay away from them they're teaching

153
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:46,370
heresies right and now their heresies

154
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:48,140
are the accepted teaching of the

155
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,570
Protestant churches in America

156
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,990
so this idea of dispensational in is and

157
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,330
that God operated with man in different

158
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,790
ways and different ages had different

159
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,220
redemptive paths yes yet throughout the

160
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,380
ages nowhere is that taught in Scripture

161
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,540
no we're only taught we've really in

162
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,430
Jesus himself only taught to pass there

163
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,750
was the Old Covenant and there was the

164
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,280
New Covenant that was it

165
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,660
that's right wasn't different ages there

166
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,410
wasn't different time periods or

167
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,870
anything like that

168
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,180
so it seems to me lirik that something

169
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,160
as big as that Jesus himself would have

170
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,350
been addressing and said now listen guys

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,510
there were you know seven different ages

172
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,090
throughout time but he only stressed

173
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,920
two ages the age of the Old Covenant and

174
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,660
the age of the New Covenant and the

175
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,630
Apostle Paul didn't see it either did he

176
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,000
no he never mentioned it at any time and

177
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,330
yet Paul had been given perfect

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,599
knowledge of the kingdom and so the

179
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:45,050
brethren under John Nelson Darby they

180
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,650
they concoct it what I have coined the

181
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,700
name

182
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:55,190
Dipsy ISM D ppz Dipsy ISM the D is for

183
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,520
dispensationalism and then premillennial

184
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,580
right meaning the Christ is going to

185
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,350
reign for a thousand years after he

186
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,930
returns to earth right and then

187
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,480
pre-tribulation he becomes back before

188
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:12,440
the tribulation period begins yes

189
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,540
secretly for the for the Gentile church

190
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,410
right and then he comes seven years

191
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:23,640
later again to establish this Jewish

192
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:25,790
Kingdom in Israel so the you've got

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,829
d for Dipsy ISM I had D for

194
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,430
dispensational premillennial preacher

195
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:35,370
relation and the Z is Zionism because

196
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,010
it's all built around Zionism there was

197
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:43,680
there there is no purpose for this

198
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:47,459
doctrine without the propaganda for a

199
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,470
Zionist state it was created for the

200
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,019
establishment of Israel this is the only

201
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,550
reason for this doctorate it's a way

202
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,050
back in the 1800s

203
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,329
so you had two tracks kind of building

204
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,490
you had something building in the in the

205
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:01,470
church at that time through the Plymouth

206
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,940
Brethren and this new dispensational

207
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,459
idea that was coming about but within

208
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,500
jewelry around the world within the

209
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,660
Jewish faith there was a different path

210
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,220
building up and that was a goal of a

211
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,110
restoration of the State of Israel

212
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,570
that's right at some point and the two

213
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,000
more the same track this who came

214
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,420
together and that's what we're going to

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,709
talk about here today so when did it

216
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,510
come together it came together in the

217
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,540
early 1900s

218
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,180
because John Nelson Darby 'he's crazy

219
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,370
doctrines went nowhere they stayed in

220
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,230
Great Britain among the Plymouth brother

221
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,620
and all through the 1800s

222
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,449
and there were only pockets of people in

223
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,220
the United States who even knew about it

224
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:53,120
that that gave it any kind of of respect

225
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,910
but then there is a Cyrus Scofield and

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,709
Scofield became the the propaganda

227
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,510
Meister for John Nelson Darby 's

228
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:06,089
doctrine but before we get into the

229
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,070
doctrine I want to talk about who Cyrus

230
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:11,190
Scofield was because this is going to

231
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:15,660
blow away people if you have a Scofield

232
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:20,010
reference Bible you need to know the

233
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,589
author of that reference Bible because

234
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,320
he's not the person who think he is he's

235
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:27,449
not dr. Scofield they raised the dollar

236
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,360
it never was a doctor

237
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:34,579
all right never ever I'm gonna go down a

238
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,370
list of some things about Cyrus Scofield

239
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:40,420
okay

240
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,690
so first he embellished his civil war

241
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,690
record he was in the Confederate Army

242
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,350
the seventh Tennessee infantry

243
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:53,710
he totally embellished his his record

244
00:11:50,350 --> 00:12:00,520
and if you go on the internet you can

245
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:04,630
find a very detailed investigation by a

246
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:08,080
Tennessee professor who did a lot of

247
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,060
research into Schofield true military

248
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,730
record and that was a contemporary of

249
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,450
his age that write that wrote it up so

250
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,000
who wrote exactly what Schofield did but

251
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,400
then compared it to what he said about

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,400
his record he embellished it

253
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,010
he made up stuff he made people believe

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,350
he was a hero he was a hero at Antietam

255
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,210
I mean all kinds of stuff and and

256
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,230
Scofield just made things up but this is

257
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:38,440
this was typical of his life after

258
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,990
deserting the Confederate Army he was

259
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:47,740
given safe passage to st. Louis Missouri

260
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:51,070
right and in 1873 he helped a Jewish

261
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:58,350
lawyer named John Engels become the US

262
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:58,350
senator from the state of of Kansas and

263
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:07,420
what should say senator Engels appointed

264
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:10,450
Scofield as the US District Attorney for

265
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,600
Kansas right okay Scofield was 29 years

266
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,230
old nice position for 29 he never went

267
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,790
to law school right okay became US

268
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,790
District Attorney for the State of

269
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:32,040
California's I'd listen to me folks

270
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:37,959
Cyrus Scofield was forced to resign as

271
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:42,220
US District Attorney of Kansas under a

272
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:45,130
cloud of scandal including bribery yes

273
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,860
and laying transfers and yes I'm very

274
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,170
quite and as old money out of people

275
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,110
there were warrants for his

276
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,960
some people believe he served some some

277
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,400
time in jail for forgery

278
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,140
he was forging his forging names to

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,840
banknotes to get loans the guy was

280
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,770
involved in all kinds of shady deals

281
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,650
okay this is Cyrus Scofield so where

282
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,390
does he go from there he escaped but he

283
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,430
was always like two steps ahead of the

284
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,320
law right the law was looking for him

285
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:22,360
but he managed to stay ahead of the

286
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:25,960
sheriff well he ended up well at that

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,650
time he was married he was married to a

288
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:33,640
woman he had two children and then he

289
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:36,160
abandoned his wife and children and he

290
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,440
ends up in Dallas Texas and becomes the

291
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,820
pastor of the First Congregational

292
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,980
Church of Dallas now he marries a woman

293
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,530
from the church but he doesn't tell the

294
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:52,150
church that he abandoned his wife and

295
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:54,670
children back in in Kansas now he never

296
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,460
gave him a dime in support totally

297
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,310
abandoned them and yet he's a pastor of

298
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,070
a church in Dallas okay and he doesn't

299
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,570
tell the congregation you know he didn't

300
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,180
put that on his resume he didn't tell

301
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,550
the you know the pastor real selection

302
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,310
committee oh by the way I've got another

303
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,960
wife and kids back there in Kansas and I

304
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:20,410
got this new wife here and he just kept

305
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:25,450
it quiet okay so 18 let's see what was

306
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:28,510
at 1883 his wife filed for divorce okay

307
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,620
and filed for on charges of abandonment

308
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,830
right all right

309
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,730
so this is the record of of Cyrus

310
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:40,570
Scofield well then you know this fast

311
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,250
forward early 1900s now he's a he's a

312
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,630
pastor of a small church I think in

313
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:52,750
Boston Massachusetts okay it's making

314
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:55,300
like $1,000 a year salary still going

315
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,040
nowhere well right I mean in terms of

316
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,980
finances and things like that are

317
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,670
easiest he's just a small church pastor

318
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,820
right he gets invited

319
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,160
to become a member of the Lotus Club of

320
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,110

321
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,920
well the Lotus Club is one of the most

322
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,830
prestigious gentlemen's club of New York

323
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,310

get the money to pay the membership dues

329
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,240
the membership dues were more than his

330
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,460
salary right all right

331
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:45,160
where why would why would he be invited

332
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,350

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:54,730
join the Lotus Club well who who

335
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:59,200
sponsored him who the man who sponsored

336
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:06,790
Cyrus Scofield was a Jewish lawyer named

337
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:10,510
Samuel hunted Meyer now Samuel an Tamar

338
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,089
was a agent for the Rothschild banking

339
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,980
dynasty all right so he's the one that's

340
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,800
financing this up to this point

341
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,680
well he's inviting Cyrus Scofield to

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,199
join the Lotus Club well I what why

343
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,660
would a lawyer

344
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,449
Samuel unta Meyer an agent for the

345
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:33,630
Rothschilds what interest would he have

346
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:35,980
in Cyrus Scofield an unknown

347
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,590
undistinguished pastor of a small church

348
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,170
in Massachusetts who's got a police

349
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:44,290
record and a shady past for being a

350
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:48,220
swindler why would this Jewish lawyer

351
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,470
want anything to do with Cyrus Scofield

352
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:55,150
has learned a little bit more about who

353
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:59,080
mr. hunt Meyer was he was a zealous

354
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,230
advocate for the Zionist liberation

355
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,690
movement that was in full swing at that

356
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,910
time so they were in the process of

357
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,680
trying to come up ways to reestablish

358
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,770
the nation of Israel that's right not

359
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,290
not on a religious basis no no it looks

360
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,260
strictly this is a goal that we have to

361
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:21,130
get the land back right okay

362
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,150
mr. an Tamar played a big role in the

363
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,680
election of Woodrow Wilson okay and a

364
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:30,520
very influential role in convincing

365
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,190
President Wilson to take the USA in the

366
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,100
world war 1 now was mr. Altmire

367
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,770
a really good Christian guy no he was a

368
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,320
Zionist Jewish lawyer so why is a

369
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,260
Zionist Jewish lawyer he interested in

370
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,730
some small town preacher in Boston well

371
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,950
that's immoral isn't that the

372
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,600
million-dollar question here and there's

373
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,020
one one other piece of information you

374
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,760
need to know about mr. an Tamar he is

375
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,080
could remember I told you he was an

376
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,020
agent for the Rothschilds he wrote the

377
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,050
Senate law he wrote the Senate bill that

378
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,780
became law that established the US

379
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,120
Federal Reserve banking systems so this

380
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,120
is the guy that we have to blame him for

381
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:17,040
the Federal Reserve today he also became

382
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:21,160
the I guess the first lawyer for the IRS

383
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:26,200
already I'm not like anyone's okay so

384
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:28,780
you've got a Zionist leader a Rothschild

385
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,930
agent and definitely a New World Order

386
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,380
person yes so who led the u.s. in the

387
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:39,070
World War one who was manipulating

388
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:43,000
woodrow wilson who wrote the senate bill

389
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:46,060
for the Federal Reserve Act and now he

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,820
becomes friends with Cyrus Scofield and

391
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:53,680
says I want you to join the Lotus Club

392
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:57,490
well what happens then well Cyrus

393
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:02,200
Scofield suddenly gets sponsored to go

394
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:07,060
to London and he has a meeting with the

395
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,190
head people the top executives of Oxford

396
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,340
publishing alright and that was the

397
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:15,850
premier publishing company in the world

398
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,890
at that time rather believe it and you

399
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,100
just couldn't get a meeting in London

400
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,320
with Oxford publishing but he could yeah

401
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,090
he got him there and he got him over to

402
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,960
he got him over in London to meet with

403
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:31,090
the Oxford publishing executives and so

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,040
Scoville comes back with a con

405
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:39,970
tract a publishing contract to publish

406
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:45,340
John Nelson Darby zionists notes in a

407
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:50,890
Christian Bible gah how does this work

408
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:55,420
it's called propaganda folks the Zionist

409
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:58,020
Jews infiltrated the Christian Church in

410
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,940
the early 1900s through Cyrus Scofield

411
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:06,310
he was their little puppet they

412
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:10,360
introduced Zionist propaganda into the

413
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:14,830
churches by publishing Darby's notes in

414
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:18,940
a Bible so they defiled the Holy Bible

415
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:23,080
they defiled it they corrupted the Bible

416
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:29,050
by publishing notes that were promoting

417
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:31,900
Zionism and so then somebody financed

418
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,820
the publication of a vast number of

419
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,890
Scofield Bibles and suddenly these

420
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,070
things were being mailed out to churches

421
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,740
all over America I remember stories that

422
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:45,340
my great aunt used to tell me of Bible

423
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,930
salesman back in the 20s and 30s and so

424
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,030
I did a little research on that do you

425
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,030
know the Bible's that they were selling

426
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,620
they were selling Scofield Bibles and so

427
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,590
these Bibles were getting distributed

428
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,230
all over you know rural America small

429
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,780
town church millions million all over

430
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,360
and the Bible salesman would get the

431
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,950
Bibles for free and then they would sell

432
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,180
them for whatever amount that they could

433
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,820
get out of it well how would they get

434
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,500
them for free they the company that was

435
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,840
publishing them obviously wanted to get

436
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,040
their Bibles out there well that was

437
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,190
Oxford that's right

438
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,870
so Oxford gave away the Bibles right Wow

439
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,230
out of the goodness of their heart right

440
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,910
right no they were they were

441
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:31,590
infiltrating the American evangelical

442
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:34,050
churches with Zionist propaganda and

443
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,270
slowly all right

444
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,040
the Baptist bought into it right the

445
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,310
Pentecostals bought into it the

446
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,560
Assemblies of God the Church of God just

447
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,620
go down the list of

448
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Pentecostal and Baptist denominations

449
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,870
that got suckered into this thing yeah

450
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,790
and people actually believe the notes

451
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,980
are sacred as the texts that are there

452
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,480
and I can speak to personal experience

453
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,260
from that when I was at Bible College I

454
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,630
had friends that believe the text the

455
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,030
notes they said though this is inspired

456
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,590
as well are you crazy how can the notes

457
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,900
be inspired but there were people that

458
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,110
felt like the notes themselves were

459
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:18,300
inspired that's right and so now it's

460
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:22,660
become that the doctrine has become

461
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,550
accepted in thousands of churches in

462
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,740
America you watch Christian television

463
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,560
it's the only thing to hear the rapture

464
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,240
the rapture rapture Israel is or Israel

465
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,490
and if you say anything else

466
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,890
you're the heretic right and even if you

467
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,900
don't use a Scofield Bible or reference

468
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,690
about it has so influenced the

469
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,820
leadership of so many denominations

470
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,250
you know like Moody Bible Institute

471
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,140
Dallas Theological Seminary all these

472
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,360
different places it that's the template

473
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,020
that has been laid on the doctrine in

474
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,730
North America well sorry Scofield was

475
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,670
friends with Dwight Moody

476
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,830
now they split well apparently Dwight

477
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,820
Moody figured out that Cyrus Scofield

478
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,980
was Shady

479
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:08,140
but moody kept the doctrine right okay

480
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,200
the Scofield people are the ones who

481
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,350
started the Dallas Theological Seminary

482
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:19,360
and actually mr. Scofield I don't think

483
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,630
was the editor of his Bible yes about

484
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,720
that

485
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:30,430
Arlo Grable in yes there was a just a

486
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:35,340
rabbit Zionist a Christian pastor but

487
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:39,070
man he was he was totally sold out to

488
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,380
getting Israel to get their land back in

489
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,910
play sorry that's all I was just entire

490
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,760
mission okay he speak

491
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:49,600
he spoke Yiddish better than most Jews

492
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:53,050
and and so a lot of people think that he

493
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,480
he actually was the the editor of the

494
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,560
Scofield Bible now one thing we

495
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,129

dr. Scofield

497
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:04,659

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:45,010
as he has sworn to their fathers not one

554
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,620
of all their enemies had withstood them

555
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,940
for the Lord had given all their enemies

556
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:55,390
into their hands now listen to verse 45

557
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,880
not one word of all the good promises

558
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:02,950
that the Lord had made to the house of

559
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,540
Israel had failed all came to pass in

560
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,080
other words they're saying in that

561
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,630
passage of Scripture that they possessed

562
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,120
all the land they already had the land

563
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,179
God fulfilled all of his promises to

564
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,690
Israel and they lost the land because of

565
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,850
rebellion and sin against God and now

566
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,640
they want their land back and God isn't

567
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,290
playing that game we're out of time

568
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,990
thank you for watching true news we'll

569
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:42,890
see you tomorrow

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:42,890
