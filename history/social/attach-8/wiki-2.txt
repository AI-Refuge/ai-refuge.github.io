== History ==
=== 1970s–1980s ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, one of the Israeli government's main goals in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] was the defeat of the secular and leftist [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] (PLO), including through military actions such as the [[1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon]]. Internationally, the Israeli government aimed to contain the influence of Arab nationalist and Arab socialist governments, such as by the French-British invasion of Egypt during the mid-1950s [[Suez Canal Crisis]], to the royalists in the 1960s [[North Yemen civil war]], and [[Israeli support for Iran during the Iran–Iraq war|to the Islamic Republic of Iran]] during the 1980s [[Iran–Iraq war]]. It also refused to negotiate with the PLO, instead carrying out any negotiations over the future of the occupied Palestinian territories via Arab state intermediaries, [[Jordanian option|especially Jordan]], and Egypt following the late 1970s [[Camp David Accords]]. Within the occupied territories, the Israeli government took a range of measures to repress Palestinian nationalism and suppress PLO-linked movements, including banning the [[National Guidance Committee]] and the [[March 1982 Palestinian general strike|dismissing elected Palestinian city councils]]. It also sought to encourage the growth of conservative and religious groups, which were frequently hostile to the PLO and assumed to be more cooperative with Israeli officials. The most prominent of these groups was the [[Palestinian Village Leagues]].<ref name="Globes Obssession">{{cite web|date=24 December 2023|title=The obsession that led to war with Hamas|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-the-obsession-that-led-to-war-with-hamas-1001465970|author-last=Karny|author-first=Yoav|access-date=26 December 2024|work=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=17 October 2023|title=What the World Can Learn From the History of Hamas|url=https://time.com/6324221/hamas-origins-history/|author-last=Al-Marashi|author-first=Ibrahim|access-date=12 January 2025|work=Time Magazine}}</ref><ref name="LAT Client">{{cite web|date=20 December 1992|title=Hamas: When a Former Client Becomes an Implacable Enemy : Israel: The Likud government originally saw this Muslim fundamentalist organization as a welcome alternative to the PLO.|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-20-op-4428-story.html|author-last=Melman|author-first=Yossi|access-date=15 January 2025|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=13 September 2016|title=The Story Of The Palestinian Village Leagues|url=https://www.memri.org/reports/story-palestinian-village-leagues|author-last=Carmon|author-first=Yigal|access-date=26 December 2024|work=[[Middle East Media Research Institute]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=30 August 1982|title=West Bank, Gaza Village Leagues Termed As Israeli 'collaborators'|url=https://www.jta.org/archive/west-bank-gaza-village-leagues-termed-as-israeli-collaborators|author-last=|author-first=|access-date=28 December 2024|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2 April 1982|title=King in the middle of another Mid-East crisis|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19820402.2.75.1|author-last=MacManus|author-first=James|access-date=28 December 2024|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=27 March 1982|title=Israelis in a colonial bind|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19820327-1.2.69|author-last=Drysdale|author-first=John|access-date=28 December 2024|work=[[The Straits Times]]}}</ref>

Another conservative, religious, and anti-PLO movement that was encouraged by Israeli officials was that of Islamist politician [[Ahmed Yassin]], a [[Muslim Brotherhood]] member who ran a network of mosques, clubs, and schools in the [[Gaza Strip]] through his [[Mujama al-Islamiya]] charity.

Several incidents occurred during the 1980s after which leftist Palestinians accused the Israeli government of supporting Islamist fundamentalists. One such incident was the [[January 1980 Mujama al-Islamiya riot]], after which the [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]] accused the Israeli military of "complicity" in the riot.<ref name="Filiu 2024"/> Another was the conflict between Mujama al-Islamiya and the PLO&nbsp;for control over the [[Islamic University of Gaza]].

=== First Intifada (1987–1989) ===
After the outbreak of the [[First Intifada]] in 1987, Yassin's network [[Hamas in the First Intifada|re-organised itself]] into an armed organisation: [[Hamas]], issuing an [[1988 Hamas charter|extremist founding charter]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|date=21 December 2023|title=A Gaza Conundrum: The Story Behind the Rise of Hamas|url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-gaza-conundrum-the-story-behind-the-rise-of-hamas-a-d9e30bb6-2295-45a1-825c-dbd0c43c3613|author-last=Zand|author-first=Bernhard|access-date=12 January 2025|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref> However, until Hamas carried out its [[Killing of Avi Sasportas and Ilan Saadon|first attacks]] in the spring of 1989, the Israeli government continued to encourage its growth.

Qatar started sending money to the Gaza Strip on a monthly basis in 2018. $15 million worth of cash-filled suitcases were transported into Gaza by the Qataris via Israeli territory. The payments commenced due to the 2017 decision by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] (PA), an administration in the Israeli-occupied [[West Bank]] and rival to Hamas, to cut government employee salaries in Gaza. At the time, the PA objected to the funds, which Hamas said was intended for both medical and governmental salary payments.
