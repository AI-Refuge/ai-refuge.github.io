During the first 48 hours of Israel's retaliatory attack, IDF chief [[Herzi Halevi]] reported that the IDF attacked 1,000 targets. According to his wife, he told her that "Gaza will be destroyed". Reportedly, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] subsequently said he wanted 5,000 targets to be attacked, even though the IDF had not confirmed 5,000 enemy targets. Artificial intelligence was used to generate a list of targets, in many cases based on unconfirmed or outdated intelligence. About 10,000 Palestinians were killed in a month, including entire families. [[Shmuel Lederman]] called this "as criminal as it gets".{{sfn|Lederman|2025|p=7}}

=== Indirect deaths ===
[[File:Mother cries for her 4-year-old daughter, who lost her life due to malnutrition and lack of treatment due to the war on Gaza, Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|Mother cries for her 4-year-old daughter, who died due to [[malnutrition]] and lack of treatment]]
Rasha Khatib, [[Martin McKee]], and [[Salim Yusuf]] published an estimate of the number of deaths, directly or indirectly caused by the conflict, that as of July 2024 had already occurred or would occur in the coming months and years. Indirect Palestinian deaths from disease are expected to be much higher due to the intensity of the conflict, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, lack of food, water, shelter, and safe places for civilians to flee, and reduction in [[UNRWA]] funding. They estimated that the total conflict-related deaths in Gaza will likely be four to 16 times higher than the reported death toll. By multiplying the reported deaths by five, they argued that "186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza".<ref name="KhatibMcKeeYusuf">{{harvnb|Khatib|McKee|Yusuf|2024}}: "Armed conflicts have indirect health implications beyond the direct harm from violence. Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive, communicable, and non-communicable diseases. The total death toll is expected to be large given the intensity of this conflict; destroyed health-care infrastructure; severe shortages of food, water, and shelter; the population's inability to flee to safe places; and the loss of funding to UNRWA, one of the very few humanitarian organisations still active in the Gaza Strip. In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37,396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2,375,259, this would translate to 7.9% of the total population in the Gaza Strip."</ref> Spagat wrote that their estimate "lacks a solid foundation and is implausible",<ref>{{cite web |last=Spagat |first=Mike |date=10 July 2024 |title=A critical analysis of The Lancet's letter "Counting the Dead in Gaza: Difficult but Essential".

Since October 2023, Israel's evacuation orders have displaced 1.9 million people—nearly Gaza's entire population—through unclear, inconsistent directives, often issued amid bombings, leaving civilians with no safe routes or destinations. Humanitarian zones were repeatedly attacked, while Israel blocked aid, leading to starvation, destroyed infrastructure, and uninhabitable conditions. Senior Israeli officials openly declared intentions to reduce Gaza's territory and push Palestinians out, reinforcing policies of [[ethnic cleansing]] and permanent displacement.

=== Preventing births ===
In March 2025, a UN investigation concluded that Israel had committed genocidal acts in Gaza by systematically destroying its reproductive healthcare facilities while imposing a siege preventing necessary medications for deliveries, pregnancies, and [[Neonatal nursing|neonatal care]], causing "irreversible" harm to Palestinians' reproductive prospects in Gaza. The commission also found that Israeli forces intentionally destroyed Gaza's main [[IVF|in-vitro]] [[fertility clinic]], Al-Basma IVF Centre, which served 2,000 to 3,000 patients a month. Israel destroyed about 4,000 [[embryo]]s and 1,000 specimens of [[sperm]] and unfertilised [[Egg cell|eggs]] in the attack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shubailat |first1=Nadine |last2=Alcini |first2=Camilla |date=24 April 2024 |title=Over 4,000 IVF embryos destroyed in 1 shelling at Gaza's largest fertility center, director says |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/4000-ivf-embryos-destroyed-1-shelling-gazas-largest/story?id=109350404 |work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |access-date=11 May 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240506030400/https://abcnews.go.com/International/4000-ivf-embryos-destroyed-1-shelling-gazas-largest/story%3Fid%3D109350404 |archive-date=6 May 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Salem |first1=Saleh |last2=Creidi |first2=Imad |last3=Mills |first3=Andrew |date=17 April 2024 |title=Gaza's IVF embryos destroyed by Israeli strike |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/5000-lives-one-shell-gazas-ivf-embryos-destroyed-by-israeli-strike-2024-04-17/ |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=11 May 2025 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240417122745/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/5000-lives-one-shell-gazas-ivf-embryos-destroyed-by-israeli-strike-2024-04-17/ |archive-date=17 April 2024}}</ref> No evidence that the building was used for military purposes was found.

=== Targeting of specific professions ===

==== Educationalists ====
The killing of educationalists, and destruction of educational infrastructure such as schools and  universities, has been recognised by scholars as a component part of the Gaza Genocide. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alarabeed |first=Wadee |date=2025-11-11 |title=The banality of scholasticide: the role of universities and academia in an age of genocide |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767724.2025.2577694 |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |language=en |pages=1–16 |doi=10.1080/14767724.2025.2577694 |issn=1476-7724}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Pratt |first=Nicola |date=2025-11-25 |title=Scholasticide in Gaza: Settler Colonial Elimination, Genocide, and the Crisis of Academic Responsibility |url=https://www.e-ir.info/2025/11/25/scholasticide-in-gaza-settler-colonial-elimination-genocide-and-the-crisis-of-academic-responsibility/ |access-date=2026-01-23 |website=E-International Relations |language=en-US}}</ref> The IAGS in its 2025 resolution declaring  that Israel’s policies and actions in Gaza had met the legal definition of genocide, used the fact that  "Israel has destroyed schools, universities, libraries, museums, and archives, all of them essential to the continued existence of Palestinian collective well-being and identity;" in support of its resolution.<ref name="IAGSResolution" />

United Nations  [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteurs]] and experts suggested that there was "an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system, an action known as ‘[[scholasticide]]” , The experts said that 'The attacks "present a systematic pattern of violence aimed at dismantling the very foundation of Palestinian society”.<ref name="scholasticide" />

South Africa, in its filing with the ICJ charging Israel with the crime of genocide, cited the destruction of 4 universities and the killing of leading Palestinian academics Professor [[Sufian Tayeh]], the President of the Islamic University; Dr [[Ahmed Hamdi Abo Absa]], Dean of the Software Engineering Department at the University of Palestine;  Professor [[Muhammad Eid Shabir]], Professor of Immunology and Virology, and former President of the Islamic University of Gaza, and Professor [[Refaat Alareer]], poet and Professor of Comparative Literature and Creative Writing at the Islamic University of Gaza.<ref name="ICJ-2023-12-29" />

Researchers at Birzeit university called the killing of educationalists to be  "deliberate and systematic".

The IDF has been accused of directly targeting journalists and media organisations despite clear marking and  protective measures. Al Jazeera reported that 278 journalists and 706 family members of Palestinian journalists have been killed during the "genocidal war" since October 2023. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Gjevori |first=Elis |date=2025-12-28 |title=Israel kills over 700 relatives of Palestinian journalists in Gaza: Report |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/28/israel-kills-over-700-relatives-of-palestinian-journalists-in-gaza-report |access-date=2026-01-20 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Akila">{{Cite book |last=Akila |first=Hiba |title=Eliminating Witnessess on Genocide and Eithnic Cleansing Crimes in the Gaza Strip |publisher=Palestinian Center for Human Rights}}</ref>

The [[Reporters sans frontieres|RSF]] accused the IDF, in a case filed with the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], of the targeted killing of 7 journalists in Gaza, in between the dates of 22 October to 15 December 2023. The 7 journalists were Asem Al-Barsh, Bilal Jadallah , Montaser Al-Sawaf,  Rushdi Al Siraj, Hassouna Salim,  Sari Mansour and Al Jazeera’s Abudaqa.  Targeting journalists is a war crime under Article 8 of the Rome Statute. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-22 |title=RSF files second war crimes complaint with ICC over Gaza journalists killed |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/rsf-files-second-war-crimes-complaint-with-icc-over-gaza-journalists-killed |access-date=2026-01-20 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

==== Lawsuit over export licences ====
The human rights groups [[Al-Haq]] and Global Legal Action Network took legal action against the British government in December 2023, saying that the government risked violating the Genocide Convention by granting export licences for the sale of military equipment to Israel.<ref>{{cite news |last=Abdul |first=Geneva |date=6 December 2023 |title=UK government faces legal challenge over arms exports to Israel |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/uk-government-faces-legal-challenge-over-arms-exports-to-israel |access-date=11 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231213060015/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/uk-government-faces-legal-challenge-over-arms-exports-to-israel |archive-date=13 December 2023}}</ref>

In May 2025, a hearing began at the [[High Court of Justice]] to determine whether the UK had violated arms export control laws by continuing to supply Israel with components for [[F-35]] fighter jets even after other licences were suspended. At the hearing, government lawyers argued that UK-made parts enter a global spares pool rather than being shipped directly to Israel, where it is "generally not possible to determine who the end user would be" and that suspending them "would have a critical impact on international peace and security, including NATO's defence and deterrence".<ref>{{cite news |last=Wintour |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Wintour |date=12 May 2025 |title=UK's F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/uks-f-35-exports-more-important-than-stopping-genocide-lawyers-to-argue |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250517022020/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/uks-f-35-exports-more-important-than-stopping-genocide-lawyers-to-argue |archive-date=17 May 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=12 May 2025 |title=UK to argue F-35 exports outweighs Gaza genocide risk in landmark case |url=https://www.newarab.com/news/uk-will-argue-f-35-exports-outweighs-gaza-genocide-risk |newspaper=[[The New Arab]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250513144120/https://www.newarab.com/news/uk-will-argue-f-35-export-outweighs-gaza-genocide-risk |archive-date=13 May 2025}}</ref>

On 30 June 2025, the court dismissed the claim, holding the "F-35 carve out" lawful; it added that some aspects of the challenge were "not for a domestic court to decide" and that the carve-out's "true nature" was that the UK would "not cease to participate in the F-35 Programme", even though some UK components would ultimately reach Israel.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 June 2025 |title=Al-Haq -v- Secretary of State for Business and Trade |url=https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/al-haq-v-secretary-of-state-for-business-and-trade-2/ |access-date=8 November 2025 |website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary |language=en-UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20251114101626/https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/al-haq-v-secretary-of-state-for-business-and-trade-2/ |archive-date=14 November 2025}}</ref>
