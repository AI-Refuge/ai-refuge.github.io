In early January 2026, it was reported that former [[United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process]], [[Nickolay Mladenov|Nikolay Mladenov]], had been chosen to serve as the director-general of the Board of Peace.

On 11 January 2026, it was reported that United States President Donald Trump was expected to announce the individuals he will appoint to the Board of Peace within the week. In response, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Kassem called for the establishment of the Palestinian technocratic committee to be expedited.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Shurafa |first1=Wafaa |last2=Magdy |first2=Samy |date=2026-01-12 |title=Drone strike kills 3 in Gaza as Hamas prepares to transfer governance to new committee |url=https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-hamas-drone-strike-governance-f59c7e742149366e67549e7dd2e10309 |access-date=2026-01-13 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref>

With the commencement of the second phase of the Gaza Peace Agreement on 14 January 2026, it was reported that United States had sent invitations to several countries to join the board and that it would have its first meeting on the sidelines of the [[World Economic Forum]] summit the following week.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ravid |first=Barak |title=White House announces "phase two" of Gaza ceasefire deal |url=https://www.axios.com/2026/01/14/gaza-phase-two-hamas-disarm-israel |work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]] |date=14 January 2026}}</ref>

Trump announced the formation of the board on 15 January 2026 via a post on social media that stated "It is my Great Honor to announce that THE BOARD OF PEACE has been formed.
