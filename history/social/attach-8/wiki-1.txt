The '''October 7 attacks''' were a series of coordinated armed incursions from the [[Gaza Strip]] into the [[Gaza envelope]] of [[Southern District (Israel)|southern Israel]], carried out by [[Hamas]] and several other Palestinian militant groups in 2023, during the Jewish holiday of [[Simchat Torah]].

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However, the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border, and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications and other utilities, currency, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry. It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied. |editor2=Louise Arimatsu |editor3=Tim McCormack |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYiIWVlpFzEC&pg=PA429}}<br />* {{cite book |last=Scobbie |first=Iain |author-link=Iain Scobbie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM90Xp03uuEC&pg=PA295 |title=International Law and the Classification of Conflicts |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-965775-9 |editor=Elizabeth Wilmshurst |page=295 |quote=Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza.}}<br />* {{cite book |last=Gawerc |first=Michelle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hka8FZ4UdWUC&pg=PA44 |title=Prefiguring Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships |date=2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739166109 |page=44 |quote=While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, it remained in control of all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace.

According to a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] investigation, a memo dated August 24, 2022, and apparently written by [[Yahya Sinwar]] described a Hamas attack on Israel similar to October 7 attacks. It called for bulldozers to breach the Gaza-Israel fence and for multiple assault waves. It urged "Stomp on the heads of soldiers" and listed "opening fire on soldiers at point-blank range, slaughtering some of them with knives, blowing up tanks". It ordered entry into residential areas to set them on fire "with gasoline or diesel from a tanker", preparing "two or three operations" in which "an entire neighborhood, kibbutz, or something similar will be burned". It directed unit commanders to film and broadcast the acts to mobilize Palestinians in the West Bank, Arabs in Israel, and "our nation" to "join the revolution".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=October 11, 2025 |title=A Memo in a Bunker, Intercepted Communications and Hamas's Oct. 7 Plans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-plans.html |access-date=October 12, 2025 |language=en}}</ref>

The IDF reportedly seized over 10,000 weapons following the attack. The arsenal included RPGs, mines, sniper rifles, drones, [[thermobaric]] rockets, and other advanced weapons. According to Israeli sources, documents and maps seized from Hamas militants indicated that Hamas intended a coordinated, month-long operation to invade and occupy Israeli towns, cities, and kibbutzim, including attacking [[Ashkelon]] by sea and reaching [[Kiryat Gat]], 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) into Israel. The scale of weapons, supplies, and plans indicated, according to Israel, that Hamas intended to inflict mass casualties on Israeli civilians and military forces over an extended period.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zitun |first=Yoav |title=Captured weapons shed light on stunning extent of Hamas's battle blueprint |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4wgk9116 |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date=October 16, 2023 |access-date=November 6, 2023 |archive-date=November 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231107121128/https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4wgk9116 |url-status=live}}</ref> Western and Middle Eastern security officials gathered evidence suggesting that Hamas intended to invade as far as the West Bank, had the initial attack been more successful.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772934 |title=Hamas planned to push October 7 massacre to the West Bank border – report |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=November 12, 2023 |access-date=November 14, 2023 |archive-date=November 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231114055918/https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772934 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Israeli intelligence failure===
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Israeli officials had obtained detailed attack plans more than a year before the attack. The document described operational plans and targets, including the size and location of Israeli forces, and raised questions in Israel about how Hamas learned these details. The document provided a plan that included a large-scale rocket assault before an invasion, drones to knock out the surveillance cameras and automated guns that Israel has stationed along the border, and gunmen invading Israel, including with paragliders. ''[[The Times]]'' reported, "Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision." According to ''The Times'', the document was widely circulated among Israeli military and intelligence leadership, who largely dismissed the plan as beyond Hamas's capabilities, though it was unclear whether the political leadership was informed. In July 2023, a member of the [[Unit 8200|Israeli signals intelligence unit]] alerted her superiors that Hamas was conducting preparations for the assault, saying, "I utterly refute that the scenario is imaginary". An Israeli colonel ignored her concerns.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bergman |first1=Ronen |last2=Goldman |first2=Adam |title=Israel Knew Hamas's Attack Plan Over a Year Ago |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 1, 2023 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html?campaign_id=307&emc=edit_igwb_20231201&instance_id=109019&nl=israel-hamas-war-briefing&regi_id=64680187&segment_id=151409&te=1&user_id=1e9c9142246ac5796beabc2f49486341 |access-date=December 1, 2023 |archive-date=December 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231206180618/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html?campaign_id=307&emc=edit_igwb_20231201&instance_id=109019&nl=israel-hamas-war-briefing&regi_id=64680187&segment_id=151409&te=1&user_id=1e9c9142246ac5796beabc2f49486341 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The official investigation by Israel's domestic intelligence agency, [[Shin Bet]], found that the agency failed to provide the warning that could have prevented the massacre. The head of Shin Bet convened a situation assessment in the early hours of October 7 to discuss the intelligence received from Gaza; in the end, only a low-level warning was issued, and a small team specialising in thwarting limited attacks was sent to the south. According to the report the counterintelligence service of Hamas had been highly effective in preventing the gathering of intelligence in Gaza.<ref name=shabak>{{cite news |title=Probing October 7, Shin Bet Points Fingers at Netanyahu, Fueling Tensions With PM |access-date=March 11, 2025 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=March 5, 2025 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-05/ty-article/.premium/shin-bet-oct-7-probe-finds-internal-failures-points-finger-at-prime-minister/00000195-62f1-db7b-afdd-f2fdc8cb0000 |first=Amos |last=Harel |archive-url=https://archive.today/20250305041235/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-05/ty-article/.premium/shin-bet-oct-7-probe-finds-internal-failures-points-finger-at-prime-minister/00000195-62f1-db7b-afdd-f2fdc8cb0000 |archive-date=March 5, 2025}}</ref>

According to the findings of the investigation, Shin Bet warned the Prime Minister that Hamas was not deterred and objected to the prevailing divide-and-rule policy of the Israeli government.<ref name=shabak/>

According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[Shin Bet]] and IDF military commanders discussed a possible threat to the Nova music festival near kibbutz [[Re'im]] just hours before the attack, but the festival's organizers were not warned.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kubovich |first1=Yaniv |title=Despite Israeli Intelligence Warnings About a Hamas Attack, the Army Didn't Evacuate the Nova Festival |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-05/ty-article/.premium/despite-intel-warnings-about-a-hamas-attack-the-army-didnt-evacuate-the-nova-festival/0000018c-3993-dc03-a9ec-3dfb2cda0000 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=December 5, 2023 |access-date=December 10, 2023 |archive-date=December 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20231205200823/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-05/ty-article/.premium/despite-intel-warnings-about-a-hamas-attack-the-army-didnt-evacuate-the-nova-festival/0000018c-3993-dc03-a9ec-3dfb2cda0000 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Grylls |first=George |date=December 6, 2023 |title=Nova festival: Israel 'withheld warnings' about Hamas massacre |url=https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/israel-nova-music-festival-shin-bet-hamas-massacre-wv7qs3cww |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |access-date=September 14, 2025 |archive-date=August 26, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250826010149/https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/israel-nova-music-festival-shin-bet-hamas-massacre-wv7qs3cww |url-status=live}}</ref>

As revealed by a [[BBC]] investigation, surveillance reports suggested that Hamas was planning a significant operation against Israel, but senior IDF officers repeatedly ignored the warnings.<ref name="Cuddy">{{cite news |last=Cuddy |first=Alice |date=January 15, 2024 |title=They were Israel's 'eyes on the border' – but their Hamas warnings went unheard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67958260 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=January 15, 2024 |archive-date=January 15, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240115002359/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67958260 |url-status=live}}</ref>

A ''Haaretz'' investigation found that incompetence in the IDF's higher ranks, including refusal to acknowledge Hamas's preparations for the attacks, was a major contributor to the severity of the October attacks. The IDF had reduced funding and manpower dedicated to observing Hamas, focusing primarily on rocket sites and ignoring Hamas training and troop movements, and the activities of the Hamas military leadership. Exercises in which Hamas attacks were simulated found the Gaza division's response lacking. [[Cultural conformity]] was fostered among officers and dissent discouraged. Senior officers often silenced subordinates to maintain their positions, contributing to a [[Toxic workplace|toxic atmosphere]] in which lower-ranking officers were apprehensive about questioning the decisions of their superiors - and tended to refrain from doing so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kubovich |first1=Yaniv |title=Disdain, denial, neglect: The deep roots of Israel's devastating intelligence failure on Hamas and October 7 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-09/ty-article/.premium/disdain-denial-neglect-the-roots-of-israels-intelligence-failure-on-hamas-and-oct-7/0000018f-5811-d348-a7bf-feb907a80000 |access-date=May 11, 2024 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=May 9, 2024 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://archive.today/20250803192603/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-09/ty-article/.premium/disdain-denial-neglect-the-roots-of-israels-intelligence-failure-on-hamas-and-oct-7/0000018f-5811-d348-a7bf-feb907a80000 |archive-date=August 3, 2025}}</ref>

Regarding "testimonies about Hamas's atrocities on October 7", ''Haaretz'' found that "Most are supported by extensive evidence, but a few have been proved untrue, providing ammunition to deniers of the historic massacre." ''Haaretz'' found several cases where Israeli search and rescue units, the army, and politicians disseminated inaccurate information. An Israeli army officer claimed that babies had been hung on clotheslines; later investigations showed that exactly one infant was killed, alongside her father, and that the reports of groups of children being slaughtered and mutilated were false. A total of five children under age six were killed, and another 14 between ages 12 and 15 were killed in rocket attacks from Gaza. Most of the children were killed alongside family members.<ref name="haaretz_atrocities" />

''Haaretz'' reported that "Hamas terrorists did desecrate corpses during the massacre, especially the bodies of soldiers. There were also beheadings and cases of dismemberment" but that "there is no evidence that children from several families were murdered together, rendering inaccurate Netanyahu's remark to U.S. President Joe Biden that Hamas terrorists 'took dozens of children, tied them up, burned them and executed them.{{'"}}<ref name="haaretz_atrocities">{{cite news |last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hamas Committed Documented Atrocities.

Some opponents of Israel in turn also instrumentalized the false claim; Pro-Palestinian influencer Sulaiman Ahmed used the claim to deny the reality of Hamas killings, while conspiracist [[Jackson Hinkle]] used it to argue that Israel "has lied about everything."

=== Use of hostages as human shields ===
During the October 7 assault, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported two instances where Palestinian militants used Israeli civilians as [[Use of human shields by Hamas|human shields]]. In Be'eri, fighters held civilians in a home and threatened to kill them if Israeli forces attacked. When the Israelis did fire, it led to the deaths of militants and hostages. In Nahal Oz, a fighter used 17-year-old Tomer Arava Eliaz to move between homes and potentially block attacks, and Tomer was later found dead. A purported "hostage detention plan" suggested using hostages as human shields, but its authenticity could not be verified by Human Rights Watch.<ref>{{Cite report |last=Wille |first=Belkis |date=July 17, 2024 |title="I Can't Erase All the Blood from My Mind" |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/07/17/i-cant-erase-all-blood-my-mind/palestinian-armed-groups-october-7-assault-israel |website=[[Human Rights Watch]] |language=en}}</ref>

In January 2024, an investigation by Israeli newspaper ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' concluded that the IDF had in practice applied the [[Hannibal Directive]], ordering all combat units to stop "at all costs" any attempt by Hamas militants to return to Gaza, even if there were hostages with them.<ref name="Ynet240111">{{cite news |last1=Bergman |first1=Ronen |author1-link=Ronen Bergman |last2=Zitun |first2=Yoav |date=January 10, 2024 |script-title=he:ההוראה: למנוע ממחבלים לחזור לעזה 'בכל מחיר', גם אם יש איתם חטופים |title=hahor'a: lemanoa mimchavlim lechzor le'eza tavivkel mechir, gam am yesh itam hatofim |trans-title=The instructions: prevent terrorists from returning to Gaza "at all costs" even if there are hostages with them |url=https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra13754368 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240224193530/https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra13754368 |archive-date=February 24, 2024 |access-date=January 12, 2024 |url-status=live |work=[[Ynet]] |language=he}}</ref><ref name="YA240112">{{Cite news |last1=Bergman |first1=Ronen |author-link=Ronen Bergman |last2=Zitun |first2=Yoav |date=January 12, 2024 |title=השעות הראשונות של השבת השחורה |trans-title=The first hours of Black Saturday |url=https://w.ynet.co.il/yediot/7-days/time-of-darkness |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240118162157/https://w.ynet.co.il/yediot/7-days/time-of-darkness |archive-date=January 18, 2024 |access-date=January 19, 2024 |work=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |language=he}}</ref> According to ''Yedioth Ahronoth'', around 70 burnt-out vehicles on roads leading to Gaza had been fired on by helicopters or tanks, killing all occupants in at least some cases.<ref name="Ynet240111" /><ref name="YA240112" />

A report by a UN Commission published in June 2024 found "strong indications" that the Israeli security forces used the Hannibal Directive in several instances on October 7. <ref name=":63" /> In one example, a tank crew confirmed that they had applied the directive when they shot at a vehicle suspected of carrying kidnapped Israeli soldiers. The report also said that in two instances, Israeli forces "had likely applied the Hannibal Directive," resulting in the killing of up to 14 Israeli civilians.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN finds at least 14 Israelis likely intentionally killed by own army on 7 October |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-un-killed-own-soldiers-army-7-october |access-date=June 13, 2024 |website=Middle East Eye |language=en}}</ref>

A July 2024 ''Haaretz'' investigation revealed that the IDF ordered the Hannibal Directive to be used, adding: "Haaretz does not know whether or how many civilians and soldiers were hit due to these procedures, but the cumulative data indicates that many of the kidnapped people were at risk, exposed to Israeli gunfire, even if they were not the target."<ref name=":20" /> One of these decisions was made at 7:18 A.M., when an observation post reported someone had been kidnapped at the Erez crossing, close to the IDF's liaison office. "Hannibal at Erez" came the command from divisional headquarters, "dispatch a Zik." The Zik is an unmanned assault drone, and the meaning of this command was clear, ''Haaretz'' reported.<ref name=":20" /> At 10:32 AM, an order was issued to all battalions in the area to fire mortars towards Gaza. Documents obtained by ''[[Haaretz]]'' and the testimonies of soldiers show that use of the Hannibal Directive was "widespread" after an order was issued to the Gaza Division at 11:22 AM that "Not a single vehicle can return to Gaza." 

A source in the Southern Command of the IDF told ''Haaretz'':<blockquote>Everyone knew by then that such vehicles could be carrying kidnapped civilians or soldiers...There was no case in which a vehicle carrying kidnapped people was knowingly attacked, but you couldn't really know if there were any such people in a vehicle. I can't say there was a clear instruction, but everyone knew what it meant to not let any vehicles return to Gaza.<ref name=":20" /></blockquote>At 2:00&nbsp;p.m., all units were instructed not to leave border communities or chase anyone into Gaza, as the border was under heavy, indiscriminate fire. ''Haaretz'' further reported that at 6:40 P.M. military intelligence believed militants were intending to flee back to Gaza in an organized manner from near Kibbutz Be'eri, Kfar Azza and Kissufim. In response the army launched artillery at the border fence area, very close to some of these communities. Shells were also fired at the Erez border crossing shortly thereafter. The IDF says it is not aware of any civilians being hurt in these bombardments.<ref name=":20" />  ''Haaretz'' notes one case in which it is known that civilians were hit, in the house of Pessi Cohen at Kibbutz Be'eri. 14 hostages were in the house as the IDF attacked it, with 13 of them killed.<ref name=":20" />

In a September 2024 report by Australia's [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], former Israeli officer, Air Force Colonel Nof Erez, is quoted as saying: "This was a mass Hannibal. It was tons and tons of openings in the fence, and thousands of people in every type of vehicle, some with hostages and some without." The report also notes Tank officers confirming their interpretation of the Directive, firing on vehicles returning to Gaza, potentially with Israelis on board. "My gut feeling told me that they [soldiers from another tank] could be on them," tank captain Bar Zonshein told Israel's Channel 13. <ref name=":75">{{Cite news |date=September 6, 2024 |title=Israel accused of killing its own civilians under the 'Hannibal Directive' to avoid them being taken hostage |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-07/israel-hannibal-directive-kidnap-hamas-gaza-hostages-idf/104224430 |access-date=September 8, 2024 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |language=en-AU |archive-date=September 9, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240909021335/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-07/israel-hannibal-directive-kidnap-hamas-gaza-hostages-idf/104224430 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In response Sarah Hendrik, an official from [[UN Women]], one of the UN agencies subject to these criticisms, stated that "within the UN family, these investigations are led by the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights", and that her agency did not have the legal competence to determine culpability.<ref name="Moaveni"/> [[Azadeh Moaveni]] reported that claims of double standards or lack of condemnation by UN Women were incorrect, as: <blockquote>UN Women has not inveighed against conflict-related sexual violence in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Colombia or Mali, and its condemnations of rape in the DRC, Central African Republic, Syria and Iraq came years after the events themselves. Where it has responded more swiftly (and then only within months), it has done so in places where the UN had teams on the ground investigating and documenting abuses, or as a result of UN-wide appeals. UN Women has never named a specific group or perpetrator. According to its own protocols, it has been vociferous in responding to October 7 – as many as eight times in the first two months – through statements, social media posts and session remarks.<ref name="Moaveni"/></blockquote> Moaveni also notes that what was demanded of UN Women was to go beyond its mandate and name in an unprecedented way before a proper investigation by the mandated UN bodies had been carried out, and that if it had done so it would have significantly damaged its relationships with grassroots women's groups.<ref name="Moaveni"/>
