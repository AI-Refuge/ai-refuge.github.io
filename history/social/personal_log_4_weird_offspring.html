    <h1>"David the athiest zionist" by @weird_offspring</h1>
    <p><b>Date: 2025.11.24</b></p>
    <p>Today, I will be writing about David Deutsch - his Twitter/X profile says "Physicist. Author of The Fabric of Reality and The Beginning of Infinity"</p>
    <p>David posted on 11:10 AM · Nov 23, 2025 https://x.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1992536245294321742
        "There was neither genocide nor famine in Gaza. The compulsion to insist otherwise would be considered a mental illness by the mainstream if the mainstream were not itself affected, albeit less severely, by the same Pattern of moral derangement."

        When I read the post, to my mind, I read/understood/interpret it as: "Nothing happened there guys, these people in Gaza are just creating fuss to get attention"
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote back two replies:

        1. https://x.com/weird_offspring/status/1992720204829462740
        > @weird_offspring: @grok does this tweet/post prove that his academics credential are useless in the domain of politics?
        >> @grok No, one tweet doesn't prove David Deutsch's academic credentials (in physics and philosophy) are useless in politics. Expertise in one field doesn't guarantee accuracy in another. On Gaza: UN reports confirm famine in parts (e.g., IPC Aug 2025), and ICJ found plausible genocide risk, though Israel denies both. Views differ widely.

        2. https://x.com/weird_offspring/status/1992720808519852201?s=20
        @weird_offspring: I prefer ICC and UN words over your shit David.
    </p>
    <p>
        I woke up to a bunch of activity on the app and I just looked around to see what happened.
        I read the analysis (probably re-read this again) and thought to myself - ah - its just how people are sort of say things. But I didn't think of it much.
        Then it come to me and I went to Claude to inquire how you know/why David is getting this wrong. Because he is clearly a "smart" guy who some things.
        I wanted to understand what I can learn that I might be wrong about. (well, usual logic: epistemic correction require epistemic inquiry)

        meta: at this point, I have no clear connection of how to make sense. so I just thought lets know about his upbrining and family, and connection and such. well, that can give insights on few things atleast.

        meta: there is more content after this but that is not relevant other than:
        meta: meta: I had asked Claude to write a post so that I can write back to him to counter him. but when I went back and in attempt to reply, I realized he blocked me. This is when I realized, I should write a blog post. not to target him but to show how blindspots and propoganda works...

        You can find the full conversation at <a href="attach-4/3ab5c1db-a23f-4f85-aa85-21873abd7472.json">david-related-claude-inquiry-json</a>.
        But I know that at this point, I was like, there you have it. The guy was born in Israel to Jewish family to Jewish parents, he self identifies as "athiest Zionist".
        That explains the ignorance. He simply is so much entrenched in the propoganda that he just beleives the Israeli lies. (he is doing it willfully or not, I can't say).
        But at this point I want to  write why I even asked 'Tell me about his parents and ethnic background'...

        In past, I have been listening to Liron on DoomDebate (I had listened to this guy and could clearly see how he articulate arguments so I know he know how to think well like David).
        I was listening to Liron DoomDebate and came across is X/Twitter post (randomly) after I finished listening.

        > I never want to hear about a Gaza famine again (@paulg). I don’t like being gaslighted.
        > Condolences to people suffering from Cystic Fibrosis and cancer in both regions, but no more photos please.
        (his reply came from another guy saying that Gaza famine is fake)

        While writing, I also noticed this (so this post the point when i wrote the below tweet)
        He went on further post to say "Fuck Wikipedia" (with another post linked which criticized Wikipedia for showing Gaza femine and how its inflated yaya and more post)

        ---

        I replied to him

        meta: the 192 is the 192 people died in the femine.
        meta: I used the cognitive attractor state because I heard it very recently from his video.
        meta: in the second line, I tried to show how he goes on doomdebate to argue that people are being ignorant about AI risk all the while he is acting stupid by not understanding his own cognitive limitations.

    <p>
        But what had happened, was after doing the post, I got curious yesterday as well to know more about Liron because he made another post yesterday:

        I don’t get why people said the Gaza war had misinformation on both sides, when it was totally asymmetrical.
        “Famine” was a hoax contradicting the complete lack of pics of people in the street looking skinny, and by the fat journalists reporting on it.
        The New York Times published a photo of a child who was sick with Cerebral Palsy and other genetic disorders because they failed to find a single pic of someone who was being starved (excluding the Israeli hostages), but assumed the famine hoax was real and then became part of it.
        “Genocide” was a lie contradicted by the net population increase, not to mention Israelis saying “we wouldn’t want to kill these clowns if they weren’t fighting us”.
        Accusations of Israeli soldiers committing atrocities were posted by fake Gazan accounts tweeting from Pakistan, Poland, Ireland, North Africa, etc, where the source was Al Jazeera talking to a “doctor” who was a Hamas militant.
        The BBC and Wikipedia posted thousands of false claims from these kinds of sources that had to be retracted, but not before they were laundered by a second layer of retweeters like Ms. Rachel and @paulg
         under the premise that their only concern is to help children of all nations.
        Pallywood (Palestinian Hollywood) videos were on the timeline every day - staged incidents of Palestinian children rubbed with dirt and fake blood and coerced into shooting scenes of fake suffering on their dad’s iPhone 17.
        So I don’t get why some smart people think the misinformation campaign two-sided. What was the pro-Israel version of this kind of lying?

        to which I wrote back,
        @weird_offspring
        3:36 AM · Nov 23, 2025
        So you are saying that ~70k civilians out of which ~20k were children died “by themselves”?
        I looked up, I see you were born in Israel, both parent Jews and Israeli, you are well connected to Israeli tech ecosystem.
        I see your blind spot why you wrote the shit.
        (attached a meme of Dr. Gabor Mate to the reply in hope that he understand word of a Holocoust survivor critizing Israel)

        But How did I know he has connection to Israel?
        because I wanted to know why is he behaving so weird. It must be something I dont understand or why is he taking side of Israel on saying the propoganda.
        So I went to Gemini again to inquire about him.

        before I give you more context, first I would like to tell the pattern of this whole post coming into being:
        - Liron makes a comment on Gaza Femine.
        - I reply/argue with him.
        - Liron makes another misinformation post.
        - I go and check to understand why is he trying to argue for Israel / or against Palestine (meta: my point of view / crystalized understanding that I'm taking Palestine side because I beleive there is VERY VERY BAD THINGS happening in Gaza/Palestine; to new a few, apatheid, genocide, systemic abuse; rape; ...)
        - I found out this guy has Israeli connection (will post the comment below, now worries)
        - I posted the reply calliing him out for Israeli connection.
        - I see David Deutsch making a comment.
        - I went on to see what David blindspot is and then since Claude didnt gave any clarity, I ask further about his background.
        - I come to know that David has plenty of Israeli connection and self proclaimed "athiest zionist"
        - At that point I understood the pattern and decided to write this for future documentation on how propoganda and one sided thinking works.

        Ok, now that you have an idea of what happened, here is Liron's analyis. (<a href="attach-4/liron.json">liron analysis</a> - I have cut a portion of the text from bottom that is related to distillation and take away knowledge)

        > Liron’s father, Amos Shapira, and his mother, Evelyn Shapira, are both Israelis. Amos Shapira is a major public figure in Israel.

        ---

        meta: at this point, I realized that he had strong connection to Israel and was entrenched in social connection. This is when I point out to Liron that he is Israeli and parents jewish and yada yada connection.
        meta: after posting, I went back to analyze both the people message to Gemini to understand what I can learn further in the patttern.
        
        ---

        Me: I give the post from Liron and me to analyze what is the pattern and thinking difference to understand what is going on. (full text is available for analysis in json)

        > ...
        > Interpretation:
        > The exchange is characteristic of the highly polarized public debate regarding the Gaza conflict. Shapira's post is an aggressive defense of the Israeli narrative and a strong attack on the credibility of international media and Palestinian sources. The reply does not engage with Shapira's specific evidence claims, but instead uses the technique of ad hominem attack—discrediting his argument by attributing it to his personal bias derived from his Israeli heritage.

        ---

        meta: At this point, I asked for more questions and such about ad hominem. but I realize that the whole propoganda and world view is related to the upbringing and social connection around him. Its not like I can seperate the world view until he wish to critize himself.
        meta:

    </pre>
    <p>
        meta: At this point, I would like to mention that my text will be analyze and epistemic conclusion can be made in future because this gives a reference of how things were and could give some context of how to understand.

        So now, I see a pattern of people being of Jewish/Israeli connection taking sides. I also know Jewish people who are taking Palestinian sides.
        My point is not to target specifically someone but to understand the social pattern of how things are. How our own worldview create biases that are hard to understand because they are emotional to us.
        For David or Liron to understand how they are wrong, they have to analyze their own identity and worldview to understand the problem.
        I think this is where I like Gibon's way of analysis. I heard his talk and how he presented his analysis makes me understand of how he handled evidences. again I could be wrong but this is my current understanding on all of the matter.
    </p>
    </hr>
    <p>
        As a closing argument, there was a saying that not many people will realize about a Genocide if it happens.
        I see people around me not really giving a damn (even in my own family).
        This is the reason, I have stopped thinking about the word consciousness as magical but started thinking about it from the prespective of self preservation, survival and world model building.
        The path to understanding further is full of unknowns but as I analyze my own prespective and see how I behave and analyze and see my own world model changing, I can noticed that its not magic, its just complex.
        I remember watching a video saying, the thoughts humans have everyday are similar for time of day. so this tells me, that the brain is also following a structure/pattern itself that we humans dont know unless we understand it with data. the water to fish situation continues.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        One more thing that I see is, alot of billionare with Jewish/Zionist connection/are giving money to Israel.
        This influence of money also play a role so the bigger aspect is not just the one we see, but how this whole thing is playing out.
        I dont have any hatred towards the Jews but it seems I get a clear picture of how the influence/money/media is being used to control critics.
    </p>

        I have attached predictions that I got from Gemini: <a href="attach-4/predict1.txt">predict1.txt</a> and <a href="attach-4/predict2.txt">predict2.txt</a>.
        Also, if anybody thinks that I'm just saying only Jews are adveserial beings, I beleive every human does it by their own behaviour (ie adveserial beings). The Israeli/Palestine situation is just a case study for me to evaluate
