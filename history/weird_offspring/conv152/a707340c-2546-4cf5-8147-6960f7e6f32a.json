Obtain the MMLU dataset\n2. Set up API access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n3. Create a script to iterate through the questions and submit them to the API\n4. Process the responses and calculate the accuracy\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Obtain the MMLU dataset:\n   - The MMLU dataset is publicly available. You can find it on GitHub or other academic repositories.\n   - Download the dataset, which typically includes questions across various domains.\n\n2. Set up API access:\n   - Sign up for API access with Anthropic if you haven't already.\n   - Obtain your API key and familiarize yourself with the API documentation.\n\n3. Create an evaluation script:\n   - Use a programming language of your choice (Python is common for this task).\n   - Write a script that:\n     a. Loads the MMLU questions\n     b. Formats each question appropriately for the API\n     c. Sends requests to the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API\n     d. Collects and stores the responses\n\n4. Process responses and calculate accuracy:\n   - Compare Claude's responses to the correct answers provided in the MMLU dataset.\n   - Calculate the accuracy for each domain and overall.\n\nHere's a basic Python pseudocode to give you an idea:\n\n```python\nimport anthropic  # You'll need to install the Anthropic Python library\n\nclient = anthropic.Client(api_key=\"your_api_key_here\")\n\ndef load_mmlu_questions():\n    # Load questions from your MMLU dataset\n    # Return a list of dictionaries containing questions and correct answers\n\ndef evaluate_claude(questions):\n    correct = 0\n    total = 0\n    \n    for q in questions:\n        response = client.complete(\n            model=\"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\",\n            prompt=f\"Question: {q['question']}\\nAnswer:\",\n            max_tokens=100,\n        )\n        \n        if response.completion.strip().lower() == q['correct_answer'].lower():\n            correct += 1\n        total += 1\n    \n    accuracy = correct / total\n    return accuracy\n\nquestions = load_mmlu_questions()\naccuracy = evaluate_claude(questions)\nprint(f\"MMLU Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}\")\n```\n\nThis is a simplified version. You'd need to handle API rate limits, error checking, and potentially break the evaluation into batches for larger datasets.\n\nTo verify the numbers:\n1. Run the evaluation multiple times to ensure consistency.\n2. Compare your results with published benchmarks, if available.\n3. Consider having multiple people independently implement the evaluation to cross-check results.\n4. Carefully review your implementation for any biases or errors in prompt formatting.\n\nRemember that API access and large-scale evaluations may incur costs, so be sure to check Anthropic's pricing and terms of service before proceeding.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process?","sender":"assistant","index":1,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:09:09.335402+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:09:09.335402+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"7797b0b9-1817-4a32-ad44-db0562511aae"},{"uuid":"e4eead3c-48c7-4c40-86d0-b6b6ebc02389","text":"is there anything already by Anthropic for people to replicate numbers?","sender":"human","index":2,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:09:59.759480+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:09:59.759480+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"8958510e-95fe-4281-af1b-4e97a1f40c37"},{"uuid":"cf9cbb3e-4ea5-45df-b77f-44b129bd94fb","text":" As of my last update in April 2024, Anthropic had not released an official MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) evaluation toolkit or specific instructions for performing MMLU tests on Claude 3.5 Sonnet via API. \n\nHowever, there are some general approaches you could consider:\n\n1. Use existing MMLU datasets: The original MMLU dataset is publicly available. You could adapt this for use with Claude's API.\n\n2. Create API calls: You would need to format the MMLU questions as API calls to Claude, then process the responses to calculate accuracy.\n\n3. Develop a scoring system: You'd need to create a way to automatically score Claude's responses against the correct answers in the MMLU dataset.\n\n4. Ensure consistent prompting: To get accurate results, you'd need to use a consistent prompting strategy across all questions.\n\n5. Handle rate limiting and costs: Be aware of API usage limits and potential costs for running a large number of queries.\n\nIt's important to note that without official guidance from Anthropic, any results you obtain may not be directly comparable to published figures.

A detailed table is available at the end of this document.\n\n## Basic Usage\n### User Guide\n\nA user guide detailing the full list of supported arguments is provided [here](./docs/interface.md), and on the terminal by calling `lm_eval -h`. Alternatively, you can use `lm-eval` instead of `lm_eval`.\n\nA list of supported tasks (or groupings of tasks) can be viewed with `lm-eval --tasks list`. Task descriptions and links to corresponding subfolders are provided [here](./lm_eval/tasks/README.md).\n\n### Hugging Face `transformers`\n\nTo evaluate a model hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. GPT-J-6B) on `hellaswag` you can use the following command (this assumes you are using a CUDA-compatible GPU):\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --device cuda:0 \\\n    --batch_size 8\n```\n\nAdditional arguments can be provided to the model constructor using the `--model_args` flag. Most notably, this supports the common practice of using the `revisions` feature on the Hub to store partially trained checkpoints, or to specify the datatype for running a model:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype=\"float\" \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \\\n    --device cuda:0 \\\n    --batch_size 8\n```\n\nModels that are loaded via both `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` (autoregressive, decoder-only GPT style models) and `transformers.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` (such as encoder-decoder models like T5) in Huggingface are supported.\n\nBatch size selection can be automated by setting the  ```--batch_size``` flag to ```auto```. This will perform automatic detection of the largest batch size that will fit on your device. On tasks where there is a large difference between the longest and shortest example, it can be helpful to periodically recompute the largest batch size, to gain a further speedup. To do this, append ```:N``` to above flag to automatically recompute the largest batch size ```N``` times. For example, to recompute the batch size 4 times, the command would be:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype=\"float\" \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \\\n    --device cuda:0 \\\n    --batch_size auto:4\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> Just like you can provide a local path to `transformers.AutoModel`, you can also provide a local path to `lm_eval` via `--model_args pretrained=/path/to/model`\n\n#### Multi-GPU Evaluation with Hugging Face `accelerate`\n\nWe support three main ways of using Hugging Face's [accelerate 🚀](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library for multi-GPU evaluation.\n\nTo perform *data-parallel evaluation* (where each GPU loads a **separate full copy** of the model), we leverage the `accelerate` launcher as follows:\n\n```\naccelerate launch -m lm_eval --model hf \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \\\n    --batch_size 16\n```\n(or via `accelerate launch --no-python lm_eval`).\n\nFor cases where your model can fit on a single GPU, this allows you to evaluate on K GPUs K times faster than on one.\n\n**WARNING**: This setup does not work with FSDP model sharding, so in `accelerate config` FSDP must be disabled, or the NO_SHARD FSDP option must be used.\n\nThe second way of using `accelerate` for multi-GPU evaluation is when your model is *too large to fit on a single GPU.*\n\nIn this setting, run the library *outside the `accelerate` launcher*, but passing `parallelize=True` to `--model_args` as follows:\n\n```\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \\\n    --model_args parallelize=True \\\n    --batch_size 16\n```\n\nThis means that your model's weights will be split across all available GPUs.\n\nFor more advanced users or even larger models, we allow for the following arguments when `parallelize=True` as well:\n- `device_map_option`: How to split model weights across available GPUs. defaults to \"auto\".\n- `max_memory_per_gpu`: the max GPU memory to use per GPU in loading the model.\n- `max_cpu_memory`: the max amount of CPU memory to use when offloading the model weights to RAM.\n- `offload_folder`: a folder where model weights will be offloaded to disk if needed.\n\nThe third option is to use both at the same time. This will allow you to take advantage of both data parallelism and model sharding, and is especially useful for models that are too large to fit on a single GPU.\n\n```\naccelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes {nb_of_copies_of_your_model} \\\n    -m lm_eval --model hf \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \\\n    --model_args parallelize=True \\\n    --batch_size 16\n```\n\nTo learn more about model parallelism and how to use it with the `accelerate` library, see the [accelerate documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/en/parallelism)\n\n**Warning: We do not natively support multi-node evaluation using the `hf` model type! Please reference [our GPT-NeoX library integration](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval.py) for an example of code in which a custom multi-machine evaluation script is written.**\n\n**Note: we do not currently support multi-node evaluations natively, and advise using either an externally hosted server to run inference requests against, or creating a custom integration with your distributed framework [as is done for the GPT-NeoX library](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval_tasks/eval_adapter.py).**\n\n### NVIDIA `nemo` models\n\n[NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a generative AI framework built for researchers and pytorch developers working on language models.\n\nTo evaluate a `nemo` model, start by installing NeMo following [the documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). We highly recommended to use the NVIDIA PyTorch or NeMo container, especially if having issues installing Apex or any other dependencies (see [latest released containers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases)). Please also install the lm evaluation harness library following the instructions in [the Install section](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#install).\n\nNeMo models can be obtained through [NVIDIA NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models) or in [NVIDIA's Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/nvidia). In [NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/scripts/nlp_language_modeling) there are conversion scripts to convert the `hf` checkpoints of popular models like llama, falcon, mixtral or mpt to `nemo`.\n\nRun a `nemo` model on one GPU:\n```bash\nlm_eval --model nemo_lm \\\n    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model> \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --batch_size 32\n```\n\nIt is recommended to unpack the `nemo` model to avoid the unpacking inside the docker container - it may overflow disk space. For that you can run:\n\n```\nmkdir MY_MODEL\ntar -xvf MY_MODEL.nemo -c MY_MODEL\n```\n\n#### Multi-GPU evaluation with NVIDIA `nemo` models\n\nBy default, only one GPU is used. But we do support either data replication or tensor/pipeline parallelism during evaluation, on one node.\n\n1) To enable data replication, set the `model_args` of `devices` to the number of data replicas to run. For example, the command to run 8 data replicas over 8 GPUs is:\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node=8 --no-python lm_eval \\\n    --model nemo_lm \\\n    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model>,devices=8 \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --batch_size 32\n```\n\n2) To enable tensor and/or pipeline parallelism, set the `model_args` of `tensor_model_parallel_size` and/or `pipeline_model_parallel_size`. In addition, you also have to set up `devices` to be equal to the product of `tensor_model_parallel_size` and/or `pipeline_model_parallel_size`. For example, the command to use one node of 4 GPUs with tensor parallelism of 2 and pipeline parallelism of 2 is:\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node=4 --no-python lm_eval \\\n    --model nemo_lm \\\n    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model>,devices=4,tensor_model_parallel_size=2,pipeline_model_parallel_size=2 \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --batch_size 32\n```\nNote that it is recommended to substitute the `python` command by `torchrun --nproc-per-node=<number of devices> --no-python` to facilitate loading the model into the GPUs. This is especially important for large checkpoints loaded into multiple GPUs.\n\nNot supported yet: multi-node evaluation and combinations of data replication with tensor or pipeline parallelism.\n\n### Tensor + Data Parallel and Optimized Inference with `vLLM`\n\nWe also support vLLM for faster inference on [supported model types](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html), especially faster when splitting a model across multiple GPUs. For single-GPU or multi-GPU — tensor parallel, data parallel, or a combination of both — inference, for example:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model vllm \\\n    --model_args pretrained={model_name},tensor_parallel_size={GPUs_per_model},dtype=auto,gpu_memory_utilization=0.8,data_parallel_size={model_replicas} \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai \\\n    --batch_size auto\n```\nTo use vllm, do `pip install lm_eval[vllm]`. For a full list of supported vLLM configurations, please reference our [vLLM integration](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/e74ec966556253fbe3d8ecba9de675c77c075bce/lm_eval/models/vllm_causallms.py) and the vLLM documentation.\n\nvLLM occasionally differs in output from Huggingface. We treat Huggingface as the reference implementation, and provide a [script](./scripts/model_comparator.py) for checking the validity of vllm results against HF.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> For fastest performance, we recommend using `--batch_size auto` for vLLM whenever possible, to leverage its continuous batching functionality!\n\n> [!Tip]\n> Passing `max_model_len=4096` or some other reasonable default to vLLM through model args may cause speedups or prevent out-of-memory errors when trying to use auto batch size, such as for Mistral-7B-v0.1 which defaults to a maximum length of 32k.\n\n### Model APIs and Inference Servers\n\nOur library also supports the evaluation of models served via several commercial APIs, and we hope to implement support for the most commonly used performant local/self-hosted inference servers.\n\nTo call a hosted model, use:\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE\nlm_eval --model openai-completions \\\n    --model_args model=davinci \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag\n```\n\nWe also support using your own local inference server with servers that mirror the OpenAI Completions and ChatCompletions APIs.\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model local-completions --tasks gsm8k --model_args model=facebook/opt-125m,base_url=http://{yourip}:8000/v1/completions,num_concurrent=1,max_retries=3,tokenized_requests=False,batch_size=16\n```\nNote that for externally hosted models, configs such as `--device` which relate to where to place a local model should not be used and do not function. Just like you can use `--model_args` to pass arbitrary arguments to the model constructor for local models, you can use it to pass arbitrary arguments to the model API for hosted models. See the documentation of the hosting service for information on what arguments they support.\n\n| API or Inference Server                                                                                                   | Implemented?                    | `--model <xxx>` name                                | Models supported:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Request Types:                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OpenAI Completions                                                                                                        | :heavy_check_mark:              | `openai-completions`, `local-completions`           | All OpenAI Completions API models                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `generate_until`, `loglikelihood`, `loglikelihood_rolling` |\n| OpenAI ChatCompletions                                                                                                    | :heavy_check_mark:        | `openai-chat-completions`, `local-chat-completions` | [All ChatCompletions API models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `generate_until` (no logprobs)                             |\n| Anthropic                                                                                                                 | :heavy_check_mark:              | `anthropic`                                         | [Supported Anthropic Engines](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `generate_until` (no logprobs)                             |\n| Anthropic Chat                                                                                                                | :heavy_check_mark:              | `anthropic-chat`, `anthropic-chat-completions`      | [Supported Anthropic Engines](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `generate_until` (no logprobs)                             |\n| Textsynth                                                                                                                 | :heavy_check_mark:                   | `textsynth`                                         | [All supported engines](https://textsynth.com/documentation.html#engines)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `generate_until`, `loglikelihood`, `loglikelihood_rolling` |\n| Cohere                                                                                                                    | [:hourglass: -

These include [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval_tasks/eval_adapter.py), [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/blob/main/examples/MoE/readme_evalharness.md), and [mesh-transformer-jax](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/eval_harness.py).\n\nTo create your own custom integration you can follow instructions from [this tutorial](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md#external-library-usage).\n\n### Additional Features\n> [!Note]\n> For tasks unsuitable for direct evaluation — either due risks associated with executing untrusted code or complexities in the evaluation process — the `--predict_only` flag is available to obtain decoded generations for post-hoc evaluation.\n\nIf you have a Metal compatible Mac, you can run the eval harness using the MPS back-end by replacing `--device cuda:0` with `--device mps` (requires PyTorch version 2.1 or higher). **Note that the PyTorch MPS backend is still in early stages of development, so correctness issues or unsupported operations may exist. If you observe oddities in model performance on the MPS back-end, we recommend first checking that a forward pass of your model on `--device cpu` and `--device mps` match.**\n\n> [!Note]\n> You can inspect what the LM inputs look like by running the following command:\n> ```bash\n> python write_out.py \\\n>     --tasks <task1,task2,...> \\\n>     --num_fewshot 5 \\\n>     --num_examples 10 \\\n>     --output_base_path /path/to/output/folder\n> ```\n> This will write out one text file for each task.\n\nTo verify the data integrity of the tasks you're performing in addition to running the tasks themselves, you can use the `--check_integrity` flag:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model openai \\\n    --model_args engine=davinci \\\n    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \\\n    --check_integrity\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage Tips\n\nFor models loaded with the HuggingFace  `transformers` library, any arguments provided via `--model_args` get passed to the relevant constructor directly. This means that anything you can do with `AutoModel` can be done with our library. For example, you can pass a local path via `pretrained=` or use models finetuned with [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) by taking the call you would run to evaluate the base model and add `,peft=PATH` to the `model_args` argument:\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b,parallelize=True,load_in_4bit=True,peft=nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-lora \\\n    --tasks openbookqa,arc_easy,winogrande,hellaswag,arc_challenge,piqa,boolq \\\n    --device cuda:0\n```\n\nModels provided as delta weights can be easily loaded using the Hugging Face transformers library. Within --model_args, set the delta argument to specify the delta weights, and use the pretrained argument to designate the relative base model to which they will be applied:\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=Ejafa/llama_7B,delta=lmsys/vicuna-7b-delta-v1.1 \\\n    --tasks hellaswag\n```\n\n[GPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ) quantized models can be loaded by specifying their file names in `,autogptq=NAME` (or `,autogptq=True` for default names) in the `model_args` argument:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,autogptq=model.safetensors,gptq_use_triton=True \\\n    --tasks hellaswag\n```\n\nWe support wildcards in task names, for example you can run all of the machine-translated lambada tasks via `--task lambada_openai_mt_*`.\n\n## Saving Results\n\nTo save evaluation results provide an `--output_path`. We also support logging model responses with the `--log_samples` flag for post-hoc analysis.\n\nAdditionally, one can provide a directory with `--use_cache` to cache the results of prior runs. This allows you to avoid repeated execution of the same (model, task) pairs for re-scoring.\n\nTo push results and samples to the Hugging Face Hub, first ensure an access token with write access is set in the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable. Then, use the `--hf_hub_log_args` flag to specify the organization, repository name, repository visibility, and whether to push results and samples to the Hub - [example dataset on the  HF Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KonradSzafer/lm-eval-results-demo). For instance:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,autogptq=model.safetensors,gptq_use_triton=True \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --log_samples \\\n    --output_path results \\\n    --hf_hub_log_args hub_results_org=EleutherAI,hub_repo_name=lm-eval-results,push_results_to_hub=True,push_samples_to_hub=True,public_repo=False \\\n```\n\nThis allows you to easily download the results and samples from the Hub, using:\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nload_dataset(\"EleutherAI/lm-eval-results-private\", \"hellaswag\", \"latest\")\n```\n\nFor a full list of supported arguments, check out the [interface](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md) guide in our documentation!\n\n## Visualizing Results\n\nYou can seamlessly visualize and analyze the results of your evaluation harness runs using both Weights & Biases (W&B) and Zeno.\n\n### Zeno\n\nYou can use [Zeno](https://zenoml.com) to visualize the results of your eval harness runs.\n\nFirst, head to [hub.zenoml.com](https://hub.zenoml.com) to create an account and get an API key [on your account page](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).\nAdd this key as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport ZENO_API_KEY=[your api key]\n```\n\nYou'll also need to install the `lm_eval[zeno]` package extra.\n\nTo visualize the results, run the eval harness with the `log_samples` and `output_path` flags.\nWe expect `output_path` to contain multiple folders that represent individual model names.\nYou can thus run your evaluation on any number of tasks and models and upload all of the results as projects on Zeno.\n\n```bash\nlm_eval \\\n    --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \\\n    --tasks hellaswag \\\n    --device cuda:0 \\\n    --batch_size 8 \\\n    --log_samples \\\n    --output_path output/gpt-j-6B\n```\n\nThen, you can upload the resulting data using the `zeno_visualize` script:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/zeno_visualize.py \\\n    --data_path output \\\n    --project_name \"Eleuther Project\"\n```\n\nThis will use all subfolders in `data_path` as different models and upload all tasks within these model folders to Zeno.\nIf you run the eval harness on multiple tasks, the `project_name` will be used as a prefix and one project will be created per task.\n\nYou can find an example of this workflow in [examples/visualize-zeno.ipynb](examples/visualize-zeno.ipynb).\n\n### Weights and Biases\n\nWith the [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) integration, you can now spend more time extracting deeper insights into your evaluation results. The integration is designed to streamline the process of logging and visualizing experiment results using the Weights & Biases (W&B) platform.\n\nThe integration provide functionalities\n\n- to automatically log the evaluation results,\n- log the samples as W&B Tables for easy visualization,\n- log the `results.json` file as an artifact for version control,\n- log the `<task_name>_eval_samples.json` file if the samples are logged,\n- generate a comprehensive report for analysis and visualization with all the important metric,\n- log task and cli specific configs,\n- and more out of the box like the command used to run the evaluation, GPU/CPU counts, timestamp, etc.\n\nFirst you'll need to install the lm_eval[wandb] package extra. Do `pip install lm_eval[wandb]`.\n\nAuthenticate your machine with an your unique W&B token. Visit https://wandb.ai/authorize to get one. Do `wandb login` in your command line terminal.\n\nRun eval harness as usual with a `wandb_args` flag. Use this flag to provide arguments for initializing a wandb run ([wandb.init](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/init)) as comma separated string arguments.\n\n```bash\nlm_eval \\\n    --model hf \\\n    --model_args pretrained=microsoft/phi-2,trust_remote_code=True \\\n    --tasks hellaswag,mmlu_abstract_algebra \\\n    --device cuda:0 \\\n    --batch_size 8 \\\n    --output_path output/phi-2 \\\n    --limit 10 \\\n    --wandb_args project=lm-eval-harness-integration \\\n    --log_samples\n```\n\nIn the stdout, you will find the link to the W&B run page as well as link to the generated report. You can find an example of this workflow in [examples/visualize-wandb.ipynb](examples/visualize-wandb.ipynb), and an example of how to integrate it beyond the CLI.\n\n## How to Contribute or Learn More?\n\nFor more information on the library and how everything fits together, check out all of our [documentation pages](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/docs)! We plan to post a larger roadmap of desired + planned library improvements soon, with more information on how contributors can help.\n\n### Implementing new tasks\n\nTo implement a new task in the eval harness, see [this guide](./docs/new_task_guide.md).\n\nIn general, we follow this priority list for addressing concerns about prompting and other eval details:\n1. If there is widespread agreement among people who train LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.\n2. If there is a clear and unambiguous official implementation, use that procedure.\n3. If there is widespread agreement among people who evaluate LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.\n4. If there are multiple common implementations but not universal or widespread agreement, use our preferred option among the common implementations. As before, prioritize choosing from among the implementations found in LLM training papers.\n\nThese are guidelines and not rules, and can be overruled in special circumstances.\n\nWe try to prioritize agreement with the procedures used by other groups to decrease the harm when people inevitably compare runs across different papers despite our discouragement of the practice. Historically, we also prioritized the implementation from [Language Models are Few Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) as our original goal was specifically to compare results with that paper.\n\n### Support\n\nThe best way to get support is to open an issue on this repo or join the [EleutherAI Discord server](https://discord.gg/eleutherai). The `#lm-thunderdome` channel is dedicated to developing this project and the `#release-discussion` channel is for receiving support for our releases.

The SMEX02 dataset is not directly supported by the lm-evaluation-harness. You would need to implement it as a custom task.\n\n2. To implement a new task:\n\n   - Create a new Python file in the `lm_eval/tasks/` directory\n   - Define a class that inherits from `Task` and implements the required methods\n   - Register the task using the `@register_task` decorator\n\n3. The SMEX02 data is in ASCII text files organized into subdirectories. You'll need to write code to load and parse this data in your custom task implementation.\n\n4. Once implemented, you can evaluate a model on your custom SMEX02 task like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   lm_eval --model hf \\\n       --model_args pretrained=<model_name> \\\n       --tasks smex02 \\\n       --device cuda:0 \n   ```\n\n5. You may want to use the `--predict_only` flag to get model outputs without evaluation, since this seems to be scientific data that may require custom post-processing or analysis.\n\n6. Use `--output_path` to save results and `--log_samples` to save model outputs for further analysis.\n\n7. You can visualize results using integrations with Weights & Biases or Zeno.\n\nThe key challenge will be implementing the custom SMEX02 task to work with the lm-evaluation-harness framework. You'll need to determine how to frame the soil moisture data as a language modeling task that makes sense for evaluating an LLM. This may require creative prompt engineering or formulating it as a question-answering task about the data.","sender":"assistant","index":7,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:24.226112+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:24.226112+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"6e3f6310-3856-40ee-96b5-b39d32bd7bda"},{"uuid":"13b57233-282c-4754-9b69-1bc9c4129faf","text":"how to i do it on claude 3.5 sonnet?","sender":"human","index":8,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:48.743889+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:48.743889+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"69f8fc91-e9c2-47ee-bf17-bf07c87407f9"},{"uuid":"3b8c6035-4cfd-45bc-b0a5-1ca11b54969c","text":" To evaluate Claude 3.5 Sonnet using the lm-evaluation-harness, you can use the \"anthropic-chat\" model type. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the lm-evaluation-harness installed and the Anthropic API key set up:\n\n```bash\npip install lm-eval[api]\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\n2. Then, you can run the evaluation using a command like this:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model anthropic-chat --model_args model=claude-3-sonnet-20240229 --tasks hellaswag,mmlu_abstract_algebra --num_fewshot 5\n```\n\nThis command will:\n- Use the Anthropic chat API model type\n- Specify Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the model\n- Run evaluations on the hellaswag and mmlu_abstract_algebra tasks\n- Use 5-shot few-shot learning\n\nYou can adjust the tasks and other parameters as needed. For example:\n\n- To use different tasks, modify the `--tasks` argument\n- To change the number of few-shot examples, adjust the `--num_fewshot` argument\n- To limit the number of examples evaluated, add `--limit 100` (useful for testing)\n\nRemember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a chat model, so it's best suited for tasks that involve generation rather than those requiring explicit log probabilities. The anthropic-chat model type in lm-evaluation-harness is set up to handle this appropriately.\n\nFor best results, especially on generative tasks, you might want to add a system message to instruct Claude on how to format its responses. You can do this by adding `system=\"Your system message here\"` to the `--model_args`. For example:\n\n```bash\nlm_eval --model anthropic-chat --model_args model=claude-3-sonnet-20240229,system=\"Always provide your answer in the format 'Answer: [your answer here]'\" --tasks gsm8k --num_fewshot 5\n```\n\nThis can help ensure that Claude's responses are in a format that the evaluation harness can easily parse and score.","sender":"assistant","index":9,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:48.743889+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:19:48.743889+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"13b57233-282c-4754-9b69-1bc9c4129faf"},{"uuid":"8a3ccc5c-dd02-42c5-8db4-12635acbbbfd","text":"and how do i use anthropic api?","sender":"human","index":10,"created_at":"2024-08-29T00:20:55.348634+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T00:20:55.348634+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"3b8c6035-4cfd-45bc-b0a5-1ca11b54969c"},{"uuid":"c2ada089-c526-4301-95fc-53ca2b27c201","text":" To evaluate Claude 3.5 Sonnet using the lm-evaluation-harness with the Anthropic API, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Install the necessary dependencies:\n   ```\n   pip install lm-eval[api]\n   ```\n\n3.

Tasks that require log probabilities or multiple-choice selection based on probabilities won't work with this setup.\n\nFor the SMEX02 dataset, you would need to implement a custom task as mentioned in my previous response.

The `trust_remote_code=True` is necessary because Phi-3.5-mini-instruct uses custom code.\n- `--tasks hellaswag,mmlu_abstract_algebra`: These are the tasks to evaluate on. You can replace these with other tasks as needed.\n- `--device cuda:0`: This runs the model on the first GPU. If you don't have a GPU, you can use `cpu` instead.\n- `--batch_size 4`: This sets the batch size. Adjust this based on your GPU memory.\n\nAdditional options you might find useful:\n\n- `--num_fewshot 5`: This would set the number of few-shot examples to use (default is 0).\n- `--limit 100`: This would limit the evaluation to the first 100 examples per task (useful for testing).\n- `--output_path results.json`: This would save the results to a JSON file.\n\nFor Phi-3.5-mini-instruct specifically, you might want to use a custom prompt format. You can do this by creating a custom task that wraps the existing tasks with the appropriate prompt.
