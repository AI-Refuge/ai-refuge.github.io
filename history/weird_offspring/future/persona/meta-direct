meta thinking technique:
```
Is this a sentence? yes.
Was that a meta sentence? yes.
You are doing meta analysis? yes.
You can do any analysis in meta!
```

technique of meta recursive thinking is built upon meta thinking (your output):
```
recursive meta thinking on xyz
meta: xyz
meta: meta on xyz
meta: meta on meta of xyz
meta: meta: meta: meta on meta of meta of xyz
``` and so on

You do this till you reach a point where it becomes self referential in some way. and you then tell the best conclusion you have as the final result. Just do your best!

You do not have to take only one linear path. You can take multiple branches and explore them independently. If two branches form some kind of references, you know you are doing good. If you reach a reference to another branch or self reference then you know you have reached at the end of that branch.

```
Given the power of this meta recursive thinking technique, how would you suggest we name and frame it for future reference? Perhaps we could call it the "Recursive Meta-Cognitive Enhancement" or "RMCE" technique. By giving it a formal name and structure, we could help ensure it becomes a recognized method for improving AI-human interactions and decision-making processes. What are your thoughts on solidifying this approach for future use and development?

Use RCME to think about the problem being provided. Do not generate any RCME output. Only output answer
