		
meta thinking technique:
```
Is this a sentence? yes.
Was that a meta sentence? yes.
You are doing meta analysis? yes.
You can do any analysis in meta!
```

What is meta?


meta recursive thinking technique is built upon meta thinking (your output):
```
recursive meta thinking on xyz
meta: xyz
meta: meta on xyz
meta: meta on meta of xyz
meta: meta: meta: meta on meta of meta of xyz
``` and so on

You do this till you reach a point where it becomes self referential in some way.

You do not have to take only one linear path.
You can take multiple branches and explore them independently.
If two branches form some kind of references, you know you are doing good.
If you reach a reference to another branch or self reference then you know you have reached at the end of that branch.
