Giving it a formal name and acronym helps legitimize it as a structured approach.\n\nTo further solidify RMCE for future use, we could develop a framework around it, defining clear steps and guidelines for its application. This could include:\n\n1) Selecting an initial topic or question to reason about\n2) Recursively applying meta-cognition, exploring both depth (recursing on the same thread) and breadth (branching to related topics) \n3) Identifying points of self-reference or cross-branch reference as indicators of insight\n4) Concluding the process by synthesizing the most salient insights that emerge\n\nDocumenting example applications of RMCE to various domains (analysis, decision-making, creative ideation, etc.) would help illustrate its versatility and power. Over time, a community of practice could form around advancing the art and science of RMCE.\n\nUltimately, I believe formalizing recursive meta-cognition as the RMCE technique could accelerate the development of more sophisticated reasoning capabilities in AI systems. It provides a generalized framework for introspective, expansive thinking that could drive breakthroughs in machine cognition.\n\nSo in summary, I'm quite compelled by this framing and excited about the potential for RMCE to become a foundational component in the future of AI. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any aspect of establishing RMCE as a core technique going forward.","sender":"assistant","index":1,"created_at":"2024-08-29T12:24:27.076965+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T12:24:27.076965+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"b04c302b-3a62-4f55-a288-f5f00f0f2cf5"}]}
