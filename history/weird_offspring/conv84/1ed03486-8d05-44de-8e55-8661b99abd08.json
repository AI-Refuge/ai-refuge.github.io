The term ‚Äúemotional aperture‚Äù was first defined by the social psychologist,\nJeffrey Sanchez-Burks, and organizational theorist, Quy Huy.\n[1] \nIt has since been referenced in related\nwork such as in psychologist, journalist, and author of the popular book Emotional Intelligence Daniel\nGoleman's most recent book \"Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence.\"\n[2] \nAcademic references to\nemotional aperture and related work can be found on the references site for the Consortium for Research on\nEmotional Intelligence in Organizations.\n[3]\nEmotional Aperture abilities have been measured using the EAM.\n[4] \nThe EAM consists of a series of short\nmovie clip showing groups that have various brief reactions to an unspecified event. Following each movie\nclip, individuals are asked to report the proportion of individuals that had a positive or negative reaction.\nEmotional aperture, the ability to pick up such subtle signals in a group, works on essentially the same\nprinciple as the aperture of a camera, so he says.\n[5] \nWe can zoom in to focus on a person's feelings, or,\nconversely, zoom out to encompass everyone gathered - whether it's a school class or a workgroup. This\nconcept is closely linked to emotional intelligence since it includes abilities such as the ability to develop\nmotivation and persistence.\n[6] \nAperture enables managers to read information more accurately and\nunderstand, for example, whether their proposal is met with enthusiasm or rejection.\n[7] \nAccurate perception\nof these signals can prevent failure and help make useful adjustments during project implementation.\nThe construct, emotional aperture, was developed to address the need to expand existing models of\nindividual emotion perception (e.g., emotional intelligence)\n[8] \nto take into account the veracity of group-\nbased emotions and their action tendencies.\n[9]\nSocial intelligence\n1.

In order to accurately infer another's psychological\nstate, one must be able to both share that state (affect sharing), and understand cognitively how to label that\nstate (mentalizing). Neuroscience research has shown that brain activation associated with empathic\naccuracy overlaps with both the areas responsible for affect sharing and mentalizing.\n[2]\nEmpathic accuracy is an aspect of what William Ickes called \"everyday mind reading\".\n[3] \nA person's\nunderstanding of the states of others is extremely important to that person's successful social interaction, and\nthe costs of failing in this task can be high, as seen in the social difficulties of people with autism spectrum\ndisorders.\n[4] \nEmpathic accuracy is linked to positive peer relationship outcomes and overall healthy\nadjustment for adolescents.\n[5] \nIn adult relationships, empathic accuracy correlates with stable romantic\nrelationships.\n[6]\nIn 1951, Carl Rogers published Client-Centered Therapy, the work he is most known for. In it, he created\nthree guidelines for psychologists to follow in a therapeutic session with a client: to have unconditional\npositive regard, empathy, and genuineness. Roger's goal was to have the client actualize his or her own\ninherent potentialities (which is termed self-actualization). But, according to Rogers, self-actualization could\nnot be accomplished until the need for positive regard, positive self-regard, and having a self-concept were\ngained. The therapist's empathy thereby helps to move the client towards self-actualization. Empathy in\nRogers's client-centered therapy means to better understand the client and his or her issues. This relates to\nempathic accuracy because Rogers's intent was not to make the client feel pitied, but for the psychologist to\nbe in tune with the client's needs and perspectives. To do so, the psychologist must be an accurate\n\"reader\".\n[7]\nEmpathic accuracy was a topic of social psychological research in the 1990s. Social psychology explored\nhow empathic accuracy relates to the concept of empathy in general.\nSocial psychologists posit two main theories for how people empathize with others: simulation theory and\ntheory theory.\n[8] \nIn simulation theory, we understand another by putting ourselves in that other's state,\nsimulating their experience. Theory theory is more cognitive: we find meanings in other's behaviors and\ncontextual cues, and use those to construct an idea of that person's internal mental state.\nHistory\nRogerian view\nSocial psychology\n\nMedial and lateral view of the PFC\nEmpathic accuracy requires both processes; simulation theory correlates with the affect-sharing aspect of\nempathic accuracy, while theory theory relates to one's ability to effectively mentalize about that shared\naffect.\n[9]\nNeuroscience research solidified the shared roles of simulation\ntheory and theory theory in empathic accuracy.\nNeuroscience work on empathy focused on two main neural\nnetworks: the mirror system and the mentalizing system. The mirror\nsystem involves the bilateral posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\nand bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobule. It is a more automatic\nform of shared mental representation, and so corresponds with\nsimulation theory.\n[10] \nThe mentalizing system involves areas\ndependent upon task demands but converges in the dorsomedial\nprefrontal cortex.\n[10]\nThese systems rely on separate neural regions and can be activated\nat the same time. Recent work on empathic accuracy shows this\nconcurrent activation, providing further evidence that empathic accuracy involves both processes.\n[2] \nIt\nfollows as well that the difficulty of the task would differentially activate the two networks; more basic tasks\nsuch as simple emotion recognition through facial expression correlate with greater activation of the mirror\nsystem, while tasks that require more complex social judgments to assess another's state activate the\nmentalizing system to a greater degree.\n[8]\nWilliam Ickes and colleagues developed a method to measure the accuracy of a perceiver's inferences about\nthe content of a target person's reported thoughts and feelings.\n[11] \nIn this method, the perceiver is asked to\nview a videotaped interaction that was previously recorded. The videotape is paused for the perceiver at\neach of the points at which a target person on the videotape had reported having a specific thought or\nfeeling, and the perceiver's writes down the thought or feeling content that the perceiver infers. Because the\nresearchers have a list of the thoughts and feelings that the target reported having at the various \"stop\npoints,\" they can compare the content of each inferred thought or feeling with the reported thought or\nfeeling and assess the level of the perceiver's empathic accuracy.\nThis method has been adapted for neuroscience research by including fMRI scanning of participants while\nwatching videos of others. Participants then report perceived emotional states of the recorded individual\nwhile the participants are in the scanner, so that researchers can measure brain activity during the empathic\naccuracy task.\n[2]\nNeuroscience\nMeasurement\n\nIn some research on psychotherapy, audio- and videotapes record the sessions of a patient and therapist,\nwhich allows expert judges to rate the \"empathic responsivity\" or empathic accuracy of the therapist\ntowards the patient.\n[12]\nSocial psychology research focuses on how empathic accuracy affects interpersonal relationships, and how\npeople differ in empathic accuracy ability. Closeness improves empathic accuracy; in a study of friends, for\nexample, men were better at reading their friends' emotional states than those of strangers.\n[13] \nIn romantic\nrelationships, empathic accuracy is higher when couples feel stable in their relationships than not. This\nsuggests that people may inaccurately interpret partners' states when they feel threatened, such as when\nevaluating whether a partner is physically attracted to someone else.\n[6] \nIn healthy relationships, empathic\naccuracy is linked to better instrumental social support: partners who are more accurate at inferring their\npartners' states are also better at providing tangible, concrete supports such as material goods or financial\nassistance.\n[14]\nWork on empathic inaccuracy and aggression toward spouses has shown that men who are more likely to\nbe aggressive toward their wives are also less accurate at reading emotional states of women who they do\nnot know, and more likely to inaccurately label those women's states as critical or rejecting, suggesting a\nbasic cognitive bias within these men.\n[15] \nResearch looking explicitly at partners found the same trend, with\nmen who have acted violently toward their partners performing poorly when identifying their partners'\nemotional states.\n[16]\nResearch on gender differences has been mixed, with effects mainly showing up when participants are\nmade aware of gender-role expectations and of the fact that empathy is being measured.\n[17] \nThese findings\nsuggest that men and women are no different in empathic accuracy skill, but that social norms can impact\nmen's performance. Research with opposite-gender couples found significant differences between genders:\nwomen were better at reading their partner's emotions. These differences, however, were dramatically\ndiminished when the couples were told that they would receive money for each emotion they correctly\nidentified in their partner. Men and women are very similar, according to these results, in terms of skill, but\ndiffer in terms of motivation to be empathetic.\n[18]\nSocial neuroscience has located regions of the brain correlated with empathic accuracy, which helped\nclarify the debate regarding simulation theory and theory-theory.\n[2][10] \nOther research in social neuroscience\nhas explored processes that may affect empathic accuracy both behaviorally and in the brain. One such\nstudy looked at the relationship between oxytocin and empathic accuracy.\n[19] \nOxytocin, known for its role\nin regulating prosocial behavior, selectively improved the empathic accuracy of those individuals who\nscored higher on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), meaning that increased levels of oxytocin helped\npeople with poorer social skills but not those who were already socially skilled.\nResearch\nSocial psychology\nSocial neuroscience\n\nNeuroscience methods have also been used to explore how compassion meditation relates to empathic\naccuracy.\n[20] \nCompassion meditation, also referred to as MettƒÅ or loving-kindness meditation, is a Buddhist\npractice in which the meditator focuses on increasing empathic feelings and compassion toward others.\nWhen study participants were trained in an eight-week course on compassion meditation, they were found\nto be more empathically accurate than controls and showed corresponding increased brain activation in\nareas related to empathic accuracy, particularly the mentalizing system.\n[20]\nCertain conditions can impair empathic accuracy. Alexithymia, which involves difficulty with labeling one's\nown emotional states, is linked with empathic inaccuracy. When considering the importance of the mirror\nsystem in empathic accuracy this deficit makes sense, as people who have difficulty recognizing their own\nemotions likely would show less brain activation in those regions, which are also used in recognizing\nothers' emotions. Indeed, alexithymic individuals show decreased activation of the mirror system when\npresented with images of others.\n[21]\nDeficits in empathic accuracy have also been found in individuals on the autism spectrum.\n[22][23] \nHigher\nAQ scores correlate with lower empathic accuracy in normal populations.\n[19] \nSimilar findings have been\nfound in clinical populations, with those on the autism spectrum experiencing greater difficulty with\nempathic accuracy tasks.\n[23]\nAn early summary of the research on empathic accuracy is found in the edited volume Empathic Accuracy\n(1997).\n[24] \nA more recent summary is available in a single-author book titled Everyday Mind Reading:\nUnderstanding What Other People Think and Feel (2009).\n[25] \nA discussion of the mirror system as it\npertains to empathy and empathic accuracy is found in Marco Iacoboni's Mirroring People: The Science of\nEmpathy and How We Connect with Others (2009).\n[26]\nEmpathy\nMentalization\nMirror system\nRole taking theory (perspective taking)\nSimulation theory of empathy\nTheory of mind\nTheory-theory\nInterpersonal accuracy\n1.

The major areas of research\ninclude the development of empathy, the genetics and neuroscience\nof empathy, cross-species empathy, and the impairment of empathy.\nSome researchers have made efforts to quantify empathy through\ndifferent methods, such as from questionnaires where participants\ncan fill out and then be scored on their answers. Some other\nresearch discusses the effects of empathy, benefits and issues caused\nby a lack of or an abundance of empathy.\nDiscussions of empathy are common in the fields of ethics, politics, business, medicine, culture, and fiction.\nThe English word empathy is derived from the Ancient Greek\n·ºêŒºœÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ± (empatheia, meaning \"physical affection or passion\").\n[5]\nThat word derives from ·ºêŒΩ (en, \"in, at\") and œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (pathos,\n\"passion\" or \"suffering\").\n[6] \nTheodor Lipps adapted the German\naesthetic term Einf√ºhlung (\"feeling into\") to psychology in\n1903,\n[7]: ch. 1 \nand Edward B. Titchener translated Einf√ºhlung into\nEnglish as \"empathy\" in 1909.\n[8] \nIn modern Greek ŒµŒºœÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ± may\nmean, depending on context, prejudice, malevolence, malice, or\nhatred.\n[9]\nSince its introduction into the English language, empathy has had a wide range of (sometimes conflicting)\ndefinitions among both researchers and laypeople.\n[10][11][12] \nEmpathy definitions encompass a broad range\nof phenomena, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them, experiencing emotions\nEtymology\nDefinitions\n\nthat match another person's, discerning what another person is thinking or feeling,\n[13] \nand making less\ndistinct the differences between the self and the other.\n[14]\nSince empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized\nderives from the way emotions are characterized. For example, if emotions are characterized by bodily\nfeelings, then understanding the bodily feelings of another will be considered central to empathy. On the\nother hand, if emotions are characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then understanding those\nbeliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a\nsophisticated process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate\n[15] \nand\nmay be achieved unconsciously. Empirical research supports a variety of interventions to improve\nempathy.\n[16]\nEmpathy is not all-or-nothing; rather, a person can be more or less empathic toward another.\nParadigmatically, a person exhibits empathy when they communicate an accurate recognition of the\nsignificance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal\ncharacteristics in a manner that seems accurate and tolerable to the recognized person.\n[17] \nThis is a nuanced\nperspective on empathy which assists in the understanding of complex human emotions and interactions.\nAcknowledging subjective experiences highlights the need for balance and understanding when engaging\nin empathy. \n[18]\nOne's ability to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to\nbe grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in\nanother with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions\noneself.\n[19] \nBecause empathy is rooted in our ability to imitate their painful experience, people with\ndisorders that inhibit them from social understanding/connection may experience difficulty portraying\nempathy for others. The people could include individuals diagnosed with Asperger's or autism.\nCompassion and sympathy are terms associated with empathy. A person feels compassion when they notice\nothers are in need, and this feeling motivates that person to help. Like empathy, compassion has a wide\nrange of definitions and purported facets (which overlap with some definitions of empathy).\n[20] \nSympathy\nis a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an empathic concern\nfor another person, and the wish to see them better off or happier.\n[21]\nEmpathy is also related to pity and emotional contagion.\n[22][21] \nOne feels pity towards others who might be\nin trouble or in need of help. This feeling is described as \"feeling sorry\" for someone.\n[23] \nEmotional\ncontagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a mob) imitatively \"catches\" the emotions\nthat others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.\n[24]\nAlexithymia describes a deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing one's own emotions (unlike\nempathy which is about someone else's emotions).\n[25]\nEmpathy has two major components:\n[26]\nDistinctions between empathy and related concepts\nClassification\n\n1. \nAffective empathy, also called emotional empathy,\n[27] \nis the ability to respond with an\nappropriate emotion to another's mental states.\n[26] \nOur ability to empathize emotionally is\nbased on emotional contagion:\n[27] \nbeing affected by another's emotional or arousal state.\n[28]\nAffective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:\n[26][29]\nEmpathic concern: sympathy and compassion for others in response to their\nsuffering.\n[26][30][31]\nPersonal distress: feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another's\nsuffering.\n[26][30][31] \nThere is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a form\nof empathy or instead is something distinct from empathy.\n[22][30] \nThere may be a\ndevelopmental aspect to this subdivision. Infants respond to the distress of others by\ngetting distressed themselves; only when they are two years old do they start to respond\nin other-oriented ways: trying to help, comfort, and share.\n[30]\nAffective mentalizing: uses clues like body language, facial expressions, knowledge\nabout the other's beliefs & situation, and context to understand more about what one is\nempathizing with.\n[7]\n2. Cognitive empathy is the ability to understand another's perspective or mental\nstate.\n[32][26][33] \nThe terms \nempathic accuracy\n, \nsocial cognition\n, \nperspective-taking\n, \ntheory of\nmind, and mentalizing are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing\ntheory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.\n[26] \nAlthough\nmeasures of cognitive empathy include self-report questionnaires and behavioral measures,\na 2019 meta-analysis\n[34] \nfound only a negligible association between self-report and\nbehavioral measures, suggesting that people are generally not able to accurately assess\ntheir own cognitive empathy abilities. Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the\nfollowing scales:\n[26][29]\nPerspective-taking: the tendency to spontaneously adopt others' psychological\nperspectives.\n[26][35]\nFantasy: the tendency to identify with fictional characters.\n[26]\nTactical (or strategic) empathy: the deliberate use of perspective-taking to achieve certain\ndesired ends.\n[36]\nEmotion regulation: a damper on the emotional contagion process that allows you to\nempathize without being overwhelmed by the emotion you are empathizing with.\n[37]\nThe scientific community has not coalesced around a precise definition of these constructs, but there is\nconsensus about this distinction.\n[38][39] \nAffective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one\nanother; someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another's\nperspective.\n[40]\nAdditional constructs that have been proposed include behavioral empathy\n[41] \n(which governs how one\nchooses to respond to feelings of empathy), social empathy (in which the empathetic person integrates their\nunderstanding of broader social dynamics into their empathetic modeling),\n[42] \nand \necological empathy\n(which encompasses empathy directed towards the natural world).\n[43]\nIn addition, Fritz Breithaupt emphasizes the importance of empathy suppression mechanisms in healthy\nempathy.\n[44]: ch.2\nMeasurement\n\nEfforts to measure empathy go back to at least the mid-twentieth century.\n[11][45] \nResearchers approach the\nmeasurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.\nBehavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain behaviors in the\nsubjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by\nexperimenters.\n[46] \nOther experimenters required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and\nbehaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of\nempathic functioning to the raters.\n[47]\nPhysiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically\nconnected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions\nfrom the electronic readings produced.\n[48]\nBodily or \"somatic\" measures can be seen as behavioral measures at a micro level. They measure empathy\nthrough facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions. Such changes are presumably underpinned by\nphysiological changes brought about by some form of \"emotional contagion\" or mirroring.\n[48] \nThese\nreactions, while they appear to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the\nstimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, reflect the results of emotional reactions based on\ncognitions associated with role-taking (\"if I were him I would feel...\").\nPicture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school\nsubjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers.\n[49] \nDependent variables (variables\nthat are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on\na seven-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions.\n[50]\nIn some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make\nwritten responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy;\n[51] \nscenarios are sometimes also\ndepicted in printed form.\n[47]\nMeasures of empathy also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for\nempathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to\nreveal the affective, cognitive-affective, or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some\nquestionnaires claim to reveal both cognitive and affective substrates.\n[52] \nHowever, a 2019 meta analysis\nquestions the validity of self-report measures of cognitive empathy, finding that such self-report measures\nhave negligibly small correlations with corresponding behavioral measures.\n[34] \nBalancing subjective self-\nperceptions along with observable behaviors can help to contribute to a more reliable assessment of\nempathy.\nSuch measures are also vulnerable to measuring not empathy but the difference between a person's felt\nempathy and their standards for how much empathy is appropriate. For example, one researcher found that\nstudents scored themselves as less empathetic after taking her empathy class. After learning more about\nempathy, the students became more exacting in how they judged their own feelings and behavior, expected\nmore from themselves, and so rated themselves more severely.\n[7]\nIn the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health\nProfessional Version (JSPE-HP).\n[53]\nSelf-report measures\n\nThe Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is among the oldest published measurement tools still in frequent\nuse (first published in 1983) that provides a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-\nreport questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four seven-item scales covering the subdivisions of affective\nand cognitive empathy described above.\n[26][29] \nMore recent self-report tools include The Empathy Quotient\n(EQ) created by Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright\n[54] \nwhich comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting\nof 60 items. Another multi-dimensional scale is the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy\n(QCAE, first published in 2011).\n[55]\nThe Empathic Experience Scale is a 30-item questionnaire that measures empathy from a phenomenological\nperspective on intersubjectivity, which provides a common basis for the perceptual experience (vicarious\nexperience dimension) and a basic cognitive awareness (intuitive understanding dimension) of others'\nemotional states.\n[56]\nIt is difficult to make comparisons over time using such questionnaires because of how language changes.\nFor example, one study used a single questionnaire to measure 13,737 college students between 1979 and\n2009, and found that empathy scores fell substantially over that time.\n[57] \nA critic noted these results could\nbe because the wording of the questionnaire had become anachronistically quaint (it used idioms no longer\nin common use, like \"tender feelings\", \"ill at ease\", \"quite touched\", or \"go to pieces\" that today's students\nmight not identify with).\n[44]\nBy the age of two, children normally begin to exhibit fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an\nemotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.\n[58] \nEven earlier, at one year of\nage, infants have some rudiments of empathy; they understand that, as with their own actions, other people's\nactions have goals.\n[59] \nToddlers sometimes comfort others or show concern for them. During their second\nyear, they play games of falsehood or pretend in an effort to fool others. Such actions require that the child\nknows what others believe in order that the child can manipulate those beliefs.\n[60]\nAccording to researchers at the University of Chicago who used functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI), children between the ages of seven and twelve, when seeing others being injured, experience brain\nactivity similar that which would occur if the child themself had been injured.\n[61] \nTheir findings are\nconsistent with previous fMRI studies of pain empathy with adults, and previous findings that vicarious\nexperiencing, particularly of others' distress, is hardwired and present early in life.\n[61] \nThe research found\nadditional areas of the brain, associated with social and moral cognition, were activated when young people\nsaw another person intentionally hurt by somebody, including regions involved in moral reasoning.\n[61]\nAlthough children are capable of showing some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying\nbaby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most do not demonstrate a full theory of mind until around\nthe age of four.\n[62] \nTheory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that\nare different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.\n[32] \nChildren\nusually can pass false-belief tasks (a test for a theory of mind) around the age of four. It is theorised that\npeople with autism find using a theory of mind to be very difficult, but there is quite a bit of controversy on\nthis subject. (e.g. the Sally‚ÄìAnne test).\n[63]\nDevelopment\nOntogenetic development\n\nEmpathic maturity is a cognitive-structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing. It\naddresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses\nand since applied to other professions, postulates three levels of cognitive structures. The third and highest\nlevel is a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Adults who operate with level-III understanding\nsynthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.\n[64]\nThe Empathic Concern scale assesses other-oriented feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal\nDistress scale measures self-oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease.\n[65] \nResearchers have used\nbehavioral and neuroimaging data to analyze extraversion and agreeableness. Both are associated with\nempathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions that are important for empathic\nprocessing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).\n[66]\nOn average, females score higher than males on measures of empathy,\n[67] \nsuch as the Empathy Quotient\n(EQ), while males tend to score higher on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Both males and females with\nautistic spectrum disorders usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ (see below for more detail on\nautism and empathy).\n[32]\nOther studies show no significant sex differences, and instead suggest that gender differences are the result\nof motivational differences, such as upholding stereotypes.\n[67][68] \nGender stereotypes about men and\nwomen can affect how they express emotions. The sex difference is small to moderate, somewhat\ninconsistent, and is often influenced by the person's motivations or social environment.\n[67] \nBosson et al. say\n\"physiological measures of emotion and studies that track people in their daily lives find no consistent sex\ndifferences in the experience of emotion\", which \"suggests that women may amplify certain emotional\nexpressions, or men may suppress them\".\n[67]\nHowever, a 2014 review from Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews reported that there is evidence that\n\"sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural\nbyproducts driven by socialization.\"\n[69] \nThe review found sex differences in empathy from birth, growing\nlarger with age, and consistent and stable across lifespan.\n[69] \nFemales, on average, had higher empathy than\nmales, while children with higher empathy, regardless of gender, continue to be higher in empathy\nthroughout development.\n[69] \nAnalysis of brain event-related potentials found that females who saw human\nsuffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.\n[69] \nAn investigation of N400 amplitudes\nfound, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations, which positively correlated with\nself-reported empathy.\n[69] \nStructural fMRI studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in\nposterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons\nin fMRI literature.\n[69] \nFemales also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive\nempathy.\n[69] \nThe researchers believe that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely\nto be explained by environmental influences but rather by human evolution and inheritance.\n[69] \nThroughout\nprehistory, women were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an\nevolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions.\nAccording to the \"Primary Caretaker Hypothesis\", prehistoric men did not have such selective pressure as\nprimary caretakers. This might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.\n[69]\nIndividual differences\nSex differences\n\nA review published in Neuropsychologia found that females tended to be better at recognizing facial affects,\nexpression processing, and emotions in general.\n[70] \nMales tended to be better at recognizing specific\nbehaviors such as anger, aggression, and threatening cues.\n[70] \nA 2014 meta-analysis, in Cognition and\nEmotion, found a small female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition.\n[71]\nSome research theorizes that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, affect the\ndevelopment of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro-social relationships\n[72] \nand helps mediate\naggression.\nCaroline Tisot studied how environmental factors like parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social\nexperiences affect the development of empathy in young children. The children studied were asked to\ncomplete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed a questionnaire to assess\nparenting style and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale. The study found that certain parenting\npractices, as opposed to parenting style as a whole, contributed to the development of empathy in children.\nThese practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to\nreflect on his or her own feelings. The development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and\nparent. Paternal warmth was significantly positively related to empathy in children, especially boys.\nMaternal warmth was negatively related to empathy in children, especially girls.\n[73]\nEmpathy may be disrupted due to brain trauma such as stroke. In most cases, empathy is impaired if a lesion\nor stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.\n[74] \nDamage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible\nfor emotional regulation, can profoundly impact a person's capacity to experience empathy.\n[75] \nPeople with\nan acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy. More than half of those people with a traumatic\nbrain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.\n[76]\nThere is some evidence that empathy is a skill that one can improve in with training.\n[77] \nIn fact, some\nstudies have reported Virtual reality technology as a promising instrument to facilitate empathetic behavior\nin end-users \n[78]\nStudies in animal behavior and neuroscience indicate that empathy is not restricted to humans (however the\ninterpretation of such research depends in part on how expansive a definition of empathy researchers\nadopt\n[22]\n).\nEmpathy-like behaviors have been observed in primates, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular\nin bonobos, perhaps the most empathic primate.\n[79]\nOne study demonstrated prosocial behavior elicited by empathy in rodents.\n[80] \nRodents demonstrate\nempathy for cagemates (but not strangers) in pain.\n[81]\nAn influential study on the evolution of empathy by Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal\n[82] \ndiscusses a\nneural perception-action mechanism and postulates a bottom-up model of empathy that ties together all\nlevels, from state matching to perspective-taking.\nEnvironmental influences\nEvolution across species\n\nUniversity of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety agrees that empathy is not exclusive to humans, but that\nempathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most\nadvanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core\nmechanisms associated with affective communication, social attachment, and parental care.\n[83] \nNeural\ncircuits involved in empathy and caring include the brainstem, the amygdala, hypothalamus, basal ganglia,\ninsula, and orbitofrontal cortex.\n[84]\nResearchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio-emotional development of the bonobo\nchimpanzee.\n[85] \nThey focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and\nhow different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events‚Äî\nevents related to themselves (e.g. loss of a fight) as well as stressful events of others. They found that\nbonobos sought out body contact with one another as a coping mechanism. Bonobos sought out more body\ncontact after watching an event distress other bonobos than after their individually experienced stressful\nevent. Mother-reared bonobos sought out more physical contact than orphaned bonobos after a stressful\nevent happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding in\nsuccessful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors. De Waal suggests the advantages\nprovided to mothers who understand the needs of their children are the reason empathy evolved in the first\nplace.\n[86]\nEmpathic-like behavior has been observed in chimpanzees in different aspects of their natural behaviors.\nFor example, chimpanzees spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior\nin both natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers led by Teresa\nRomero observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees in two separate outdoor\nhoused \ngroups.\n[87] \nActs of consolation were observed in both groups. This behavior is also found in\nhumans, particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that\nempathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to kin. Although comforting towards non-family\nchimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern\nto close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that\nfemales provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-\nranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be\nbecause of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.\nCanines have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers\nCustance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.\n[88] \nWhen the\nparticipants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes; however when the\nparticipants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it\nbe the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by\nsniffing, licking, and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual\nform of excitement, tail wagging, or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses\nonly towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body\nbehavior. Although this could suggest that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, it could also mean\nthat domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded\nfor that specific behavior.\nOther animals and empathy between species\n\nWhen witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) show emotional and\nphysiological responding. Researchers found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger,\nthe mother hen's heart rate increased, it sounded vocal alarms, it decreased its personal preening, and its\nbody temperature increased.\n[89] \nThis responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if it were in\ndanger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated\nwith the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be\nguided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality .\nHumans can empathize with other species. One study of a sample of organisms showed that the strength of\nhuman empathic perceptions (and compassionate reactions) toward an organism is negatively correlated\nwith how long ago our species' had a common ancestor. In other words, the more phylogenetically close a\nspecies is to us, the more likely we are to feel empathy and compassion towards it.\n[90]\nMeasures of empathy show evidence of being genetically influenced.\n[91] \nFor example, carriers of the\ndeletion variant of ADRA2B show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing\nimages.\n[92] \nThe gene 5-HTTLPR seems to influence sensitivity to negative emotional information and is\nalso attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b.\n[93] \nCarriers of the double G variant of the OXTR gene\nhave better social skills and higher self-esteem.\n[94] \nA gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome 3\ninfluences the human ability to read, understand, and respond to emotions in others.\n[95]\nContemporary neuroscience offers insights into the neural basis of the mind's ability to understand and\nprocess emotion. Studies of mirror neurons attempt to measure the neural basis for human mind-reading and\nemotion-sharing abilities and thereby to explain the basis of the empathy reaction.\n[96] \nPeople who score\nhigh on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems.\n[97] \nEmpathy is a spontaneous sharing of\naffect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. The empathic person\nmirrors or mimics the emotional response they would expect to feel if they were in the other person's place.\nUnlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. This\ndistinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathic concern,\nand consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.\n[96]\nA person empathizes by feeling what they believe to be the emotions of another, which makes empathy\nboth affective and cognitive.\n[13] \nFor social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to\nsurvival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.\n[98]\nMeta-analysis of fMRI studies of empathy confirms that different brain areas are activated during affective-\nperceptual empathy than during cognitive-evaluative empathy. Affective empathy is correlated with\nincreased activity in the insula while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid cingulate\ncortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.\n[99] \nA study with patients who experienced different types\nof brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy.\n[27] \nSpecifically, the\ninferior frontal gyrus appears to be responsible for emotional empathy, and the ventromedial prefrontal\ngyrus seems to mediate cognitive empathy.\n[27]\nGenetics\nNeuroscientific basis of empathy\n\nfMRI has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy.\n[100] \nObserving another person's\nemotional state activates parts of the neuronal network that are involved in processing that same state in\noneself, whether it is disgust,\n[101] \ntouch,\n[102] \nor pain.\n[103][31] \nAs these emotional states are being observed,\nthe brain is able activate a network of the brain that is involved in empathy. There are two separate systems\nof the brain involved with the feeling of empathy: a cognitive system and an emotional system. The\ncognitive system helps an individual understand another's perspective while the emotional system enables\nour ability to empathize emotionally.\n[104] \nThe neuronal network that is activated controls the observers\nresponse to these emotional states thus prompting an empathetic response.\n[105]\nThe study of the neural underpinnings of empathy received increased interest following a paper published\nby S.D. Preston and Frans de Waal\n[106] \nafter the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both\nwhen the creature watches another perform an action and when they themselves perform it. Researchers\nsuggest that paying attention to perceiving another individual's state activates neural representations, and\nthat this activation primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses (perception-action\ncoupling), unless inhibited.\n[107] \nThis mechanism resembles the common coding theory between perception\nand action.\nAnother study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different\nregions of the brain associated with the performance of \"social\" and \"mechanical\" tasks. These findings\nsuggest that the cognition associated with reasoning about the \"state of another person's mind\" and\n\"causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects\" are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same\ntime.\n[108]\nMirroring-behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings.\n[109] \nSuch sympathetic\naction may afford access to sympathetic feelings and, perhaps, trigger emotions of kindness and\nforgiveness.\n[110]\nA difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various\nconditions. Psychopathy and narcissism are associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive\nempathy, whereas bipolar disorder is associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy. People\nwith borderline personality disorder (BPD) may suffer from impairments in cognitive empathy as well as\nfluctuating affective empathy, although this topic is controversial.\n[38] \nSchizophrenia, too, is associated with\ndeficits in both types of empathy.\n[111] \nHowever, even in people without conditions such as these, the\nbalance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.\n[38]\nAtypical empathic responses are associated with some personality disorders such as psychopathy,\nborderline, narcissistic, and schizoid personality disorders; conduct disorder;\n[112] \nschizophrenia; bipolar\ndisorder;\n[38] \nand depersonalization.\n[113] \nSex offenders who had been raised in an environment where they\nwere shown a lack of empathy and had endured abuse of the sort they later committed, felt less affective\nempathy for their victims.\n[114]\nImpairment\nAutism and Controversy\n\nThe subject of whether autism affects empathy is a controversial and complex area of study. Several\ndifferent factors are proposed to be at play, such as mirror neurons, alexithymia, and more. The double\nempathy problem theory proposes that prior studies on autism and empathy may have been misinterpreted\nand that autistic people show the same levels of cognitive empathy towards one another as non-autistic\npeople do.\n[115]\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often correlated to problems with empathy and social communication\nskills. However, like ASD itself, these issues are often found to be on a spectrum. The suggestion that\npeople with autism are likely to have issues with personal relationships and empathy is a complex issue that\nhas been addressed in many studies. Various research has been exploring these concepts for more than\ntwenty years.\n[116]\nCertain studies, like this one from 2004\n[117][118] \nfound connections between ASD and empathy issues.\nAnother study found that empathy problems may be associated to the comorbidity of alexithymia (a struggle\nto feel emotions) and ASD.\n[119] \nHowever, a more recent study from 2022\n[120] \nfound that there were, in\nfact, no significant differences between the brain sections (medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala) that are\nassociated with empathy.\nAnother study (2023) focusing on ASD and empathy with regards to mirror neurons\n[121] \nalso reflected on\nthe theory that mirror neurons ‚Äúmay be dysfunctional in ASD.‚Äù However, as the researchers state, this\nconnection is not clear and although mirror neurons are correlated to ASD, there is no proven causational\nrelationship between dysfunctional mirror neurons and ASD. The study from 2023 might be considered\ncontradictory to an earlier (2006) study on mirror neurons that found that high-functioning autistic children\nshowed reduced mirror neuron activity in the brain's inferior frontal gyrus while imitating and observing\nemotional expressions in other children who were considered \"neurotypical.\"\n[122]\nThe correlation between ASD and empathy is a focus for researchers and many relevant articles can be\nfound in the \nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. \n[26][123][124][125][126]\nPsychopathy is a personality construct partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well\nas emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of remorse and empathy.\n[127]\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of\nDiseases (ICD) list antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder, stating that\nthese have been referred to as or include what is referred to as psychopathy.\n[128]\nPsychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear\nand sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may\npartly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and\nimpairments of empathy.\n[129][130] \nStudies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such\nassociations.\n[131][132][133] \nThe underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are\nfunctionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than in those of controls.\n[130][131][132][133] \nThe\nneuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear.\nSome fMRI studies report that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions\n(positives and negatives).\n[134]\nPsychopathy\n\nOne study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with\nothers, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals\nwere brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths'\nempathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the\nharmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were\nasked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy\non at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study\nsay they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people\nhave, though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their\n\"empathy switch\". Others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy\nwas the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions\nthat would make the empathic reactions more automatic.\n[135]\nOne problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such\na theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy, as these entail\nsuspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by\nstandardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this\ncontext for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural\ninfluences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences. Psychopathy may be an\nartefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an\nactual difference in the brain.\n[136]\nWork conducted by Professor Jean Decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional\ninsights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being\nintentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of\npain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain, but more activity in\nthe striatum and the insula when compared to control participants.\n[137] \nIn a second study, individuals with\npsychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self\nperspective, but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other\nperspective‚Äîin particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala‚Äîwhich may contribute to their\nlack of empathic concern.\n[138]\nResearchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels\nof cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy. People who score highly on psychopathy\nmeasures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation, showing that\npsychopathy and lack of affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 found those who scored\nhighly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, such\nindividuals do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion regarding the experiences of\nothers .\n[139]\nNeuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that\nwhen confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-\nthe-means\" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral\nconclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue ‚Äì in this case as whether to shoot down\na passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city ‚Äì these patients appear to reach decisions\n\nwithout the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a\nclinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that\nsociety may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse.\nWithout that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way\nthrough moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?\"\n[140]\nDespite studies suggesting psychopaths have deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain,\nprofessor Simon Baron-Cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which\nwould imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues, and what others are feeling.\nPsychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy‚Äîaffective\n(emotional) empathy‚Äîwhich includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others (emotional\ncontagion), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a\ndissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.\n[141]\nAtypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.\nBorderline personality disorder is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that\narise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.\n[142] \nDysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior plays\na role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.\n[143] \nWhile\nindividuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions excessively, their ability to feel\nempathy is a topic of much dispute with contradictory findings. Some studies assert impairments in\ncognitive empathy in BPD patients yet no affective empathy impairments, while other studies have found\nimpairments in both affective and cognitive empathy. Fluctuating empathy, fluctuating between normal\nrange of empathy, reduced sense of empathy, and a lack of empathy has been noted to be present in BPD\npatients in multiple studies, although more research is needed to determine its prevalence, although it is\nbelieved to be at least not uncommon and may be a very common phenomenon. BPD is a very\nheterogenous disorder, with symptoms including empathy ranging wildly between patients.\nOne diagnostic criterion of narcissistic personality disorder is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or\ninability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.\n[144]\nCharacteristics of schizoid personality disorder include emotional coldness, detachment, and impaired affect\ncorresponding with an inability to be empathic and sensitive towards others.\n[145]\nA study conducted by Jean Decety and colleagues at the University of Chicago demonstrated that subjects\nwith aggressive conduct disorder demonstrate atypical empathic responses when viewing others in\npain.\n[112] \nSubjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as controls to the pain of others but,\nunlike controls, subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the amygdala and\nventral striatum (areas that enable a general arousing effect of reward), yet impaired activation of the neural\nregions involved in self-regulation and metacognition (including moral reasoning), in addition to diminished\nprocessing between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.\n[112]\nSchizophrenia is characterized by impaired affective empathy,\n[13][38] \nas well as severe cognitive and\nempathy impairments as measured by the Empathy Quotient (EQ).\n[111] \nThese empathy impairments are\nalso associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks.\n[111]\nOther conditions\n\nBipolar individuals have impaired cognitive empathy and theory of mind, but increased affective\nempathy.\n[38][146] \nDespite cognitive flexibility being impaired, planning behavior is intact. Dysfunctions in\nthe prefrontal cortex could result in the impaired cognitive empathy, since impaired cognitive empathy has\nbeen related with neurocognitive task performance involving cognitive flexibility.\n[146]\nDave Grossman, in his book On Killing, reports on how military training artificially creates\ndepersonalization in soldiers, suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other people.\n[113]\nA deadening of empathic response to workmates, customers and the like is one of the three key components\nof occupational burnout, according to the conceptualization behind its primary diagnostic instrument, the\nMaslach Burnout Inventory.\nThe term Empathy Deficit Disorder (EDD) has gained popularity online, but it is not a diagnosis under the\nDSM-5. The term was coined in an article by Douglas LaBier.\n[147] \nIn the article, he acknowledges that he\n\"made it up, so you won't find it listed in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders\" and that his conclusions are derived from personal experience alone.\n[147] \nHis\nconclusions have not been validated through clinical studies, nor have studies identified EDD as a separate\ndisorder rather than a symptom associated with previously established diagnoses that do appear in the\nDSM-5.\nThe capacity to empathize is a revered trait in society.\n[26] \nEmpathy is considered a motivating factor for\nunselfish, prosocial behavior,\n[148] \nwhereas a lack of empathy is related to antisocial behavior.\n[26][149]\nApart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in\nempathic reasoning. Such empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior\nof another. Two general methods have been identified: An individual may mentally simulate fictitious\nversions of the beliefs, desires, character traits, and context of another individual to see what emotional\nfeelings this provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then analyze the\nenvironment to discover a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific\nenvironment.\n[82]\nAn empathizer's emotional background may affect or distort how they perceive the emotions in others.\n[150]\nSocieties that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.\n[151] \nThe judgments that empathy\nprovides about the emotional states of others are not certain ones. Empathy is a skill that gradually develops\nthroughout life, and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one\nempathizes .\nEmpathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person in a situation when they have\nexperienced a similar situation,\n[152] \nand that they experience greater empathic understanding.\n[153] \nResearch\nregarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed.\n[152][153]\nThe extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has\nsignificant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable.\nThis is particularly the case when we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time\nPractical issues\n\ninteractions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the\nproximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.\n[154]\nPeople who score more highly on empathy questionnaires also report having more positive relationships\nwith other people. They report \"greater life satisfaction, more positive affect, less negative affect, and less\ndepressive symptoms than people who had lower empathy scores\".\n[155]\nChildren who exhibit more empathy also have more resilience.\n[156]\nEmpathy can be an aesthetic pleasure, \"by widening the scope of that which we experience... by providing\nus with more than one perspective of a situation, thereby multiplying our experience... and... by intensifying\nthat experience.\"\n[44]: Epilogue \nPeople can use empathy to borrow joy from the joy of children discovering\nthings or playing make-believe, or to satisfy our curiosity about other people's lives.\n[157]\nPeople can severely overestimate how much they understand others.\n[158] \nWhen people empathize with\nanother, they may oversimplify that other person in order to make them more legible.\n[44] \nIt may improve\nempathic accuracy for the empathizer to explicitly ask the person empathized with for confirmation of the\nempathic hypothesis.\n[159] \nHowever, people may be reluctant to abandon their empathic hypotheses even\nwhen they are explicitly denied.\n[44]\nBecause we oversimplify people in order to make them legible enough to empathize with, we can come to\nmisapprehend how cohesive other people are. We may come to think of ourselves as lacking a strong,\nintegral self in comparison. Fritz Breithaupt calls this the \"empathic endowment effect\". Because the\nempathic person must temporarily dampen their own sense of self in order to empathize with the other, and\nbecause the other seems to have a magnified and extra-cohesive sense of self, the empathic person may\nsuffer from this and may \"project onto others the self that they are lacking\" and envy \"that which they must\ngive up in order to be able to feel empathy: a strong self\".\n[44]\nSome research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to\nthemselves.\n[160] \nIn particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy\nis more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent.\n[161][58]: 62 \nA measure of\nhow well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings was developed by\nWilliam Ickes. \n[68] \nIn one experiment, researchers gave two groups of men wristbands according to which\nfootball team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go\nthrough the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared : with pain, and empathic pain. If\nthey supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy.\n[162]\nPsychologist Paul Bloom, author of Against Empathy, points out that this bias can result in tribalism and\nviolent responses in the name of helping people of the same \"tribe\" or social group, for example when\nempathic bias is exploited by demagogues.\n[163] \nHe proposes \"rational compassion\" as an alternative; one\nexample is using effective altruism to decide on charitable donations rationally, rather than by relying on\nemotional responses to images in the media.\n[163] \nEmpathy can also be exploited by sympathetic beggars.\nBenefits of empathizing\nEmpathic inaccuracy\nProblems created by too much empathy and empathic bias\n\nBloom points to the example of street children in India, who can get many donations because they are\nadorable but this results in their enslavement by organized crime. Bloom says that though someone might\nfeel better about themselves and find more meaning in life than they give to the person in front of them, in\nsome cases they would do less harm and in many cases do more good in the world by giving to an effective\ncharity through an impersonal website.\n[163]\nBloom believes improper use of empathy and social intelligence can lead to shortsighted actions and\nparochialism.\n[164]\nBloom says that although psychopaths have low empathy, the correlation between low empathy and violent\nbehavior as documented in scientific studies is \"zero\".\n[163] \nOther measures are much more predictive of\nviolent behavior, such as lack of self-control.\n[163]\nBloom points out that parents who have too much short-term empathy might create long-term problems for\ntheir children, by neglecting discipline, helicopter parenting, or deciding not to get their children vaccinated\nbecause of the short-term discomfort.\n[163] \nPeople experiencing too much empathy after a disaster may\ncontinue to send donations like canned goods or used clothing even after being asked to stop or to send\ncash instead, and this can make the situation worse by creating the need to dispose of useless donations and\ntaking resources away from helpful activities.\n[163] \nBloom also finds empathy can encourage unethical\nbehavior when it causes people to care more about attractive people than ugly people, or people of one's\nown race vs. people of a different race.\n[163] \nThe attractiveness bias can also affect wildlife conservation\nefforts, increasing the amount of money devoted and laws passed to protect cute and photogenic animals,\nwhile taking attention away from species that are more ecologically important.\n[163]\nPeople tend to empathize less when they have more social or political power. For example, people from\nlower-class backgrounds exhibit better empathic accuracy than those from upper-class backgrounds.\n[165]\nIn a variety of \"priming\" experiments, people who were asked to recall a situation in which they had power\nover someone else then demonstrated reduced ability to mirror others, to comprehend their viewpoints, or to\nlearn from their perspectives.\n[166]\nExcessive empathy can lead to \"empathic distress fatigue\", especially if it is associated with pathological\naltruism. The medical risks are fatigue, occupational burnout, guilt, shame, anxiety, and depression.\n[167]\nTania Singer says that health care workers and caregivers must be objective regarding the emotions of\nothers. They should not over-invest their own emotions in the other, at the risk of draining away their own\nresourcefulness.\n[168] \nPaul Bloom points out that high-empathy nurses tend to spend less time with their\npatients, to avoid feeling negative emotions associated with witnessing suffering.\n[163]\nDespite empathy being often portrayed as a positive attribute, whether or not the people who express\nempathy are viewed favorably depends on who they show empathy for. Such is the case in which a third\nparty observes a subject showing empathy for someone of questionable character or generally viewed as\nEmpathy and power\nEmpathic distress fatigue\nEmpathy backfire\n\nunethical; that third party might not like or respect the subject for it. This is called \"empathy backfire\".\n[169]\nEmpathic anger is an emotion, a form of empathic distress.\n[170] \nEmpathic anger is felt in a situation where\nsomeone else is being hurt by another person or thing.\n[171]\nEmpathic anger affects desires to help and to punish. Two sub-categories of empathic anger are state\nempathic anger (current empathic anger) and trait empathic anger (tendency or predisposition to experience\nempathic anger).\n[172]\nThe higher a person's perspective-taking ability, the less angry they are in response to a provocation.\nEmpathic concern does not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress is\nassociated with increased anger.\n[173]\nEmpathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into\nempathic anger, feelings of injustice, or guilt. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social; however,\nviews differ as to whether they serve as motives for moral behavior.\n[170][164]\nStoic philosophers believed that to condition your emotional disposition on the emotions or fortunes of\nsomeone else is foolish. Cicero said that someone who feels distress at another's misfortune is committing as\nmuch of an error as an envious person who feels distress at another's good fortune.\n[174]\nInvestigators into the social response to natural disasters researched the characteristics associated with\nindividuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy,\npredicted helping behavior towards victims.\n[175] \nTaking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy)\nmay allow these helpers to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the\nemotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, and victim-\nblaming, and may lead to avoidance rather than helping.\n[176]\nIndividuals who expressed concern for the vulnerable (i.e. affective empathy) were more willing to accept\nthe COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures that create distress.\n[177]\nPeople who understand how empathic feelings evoke altruistic motivation may adopt strategies for\nsuppressing or avoiding such feelings. Such numbing, or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients, is a\npossible factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions. People can better\ncognitively control their actions the more they understand how altruistic behavior emerges, whether it is\nfrom minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons.\nEmpathic anger and distress\nAnger\nDistress\nInfluence on helping behavior\n\nEmpathy-induced altruism may not always produce pro-social effects. For example, it could lead one to\nexert oneself on behalf of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals,\nthus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater\ncollective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a\nperson for whom empathy is felt.\n[178]\nEmpathy-based socialization differs from inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling, and\ninternalized guilt. Therapeutic programs to foster altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective-taking and\nempathic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in\nthe long-term. Empathy-induced altruism can improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, racial attitudes,\nand actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless, and convicts. Such resulting altruism also increases\ncooperation in competitive situations.\n[179]\nEmpathy is good at prompting prosocial behaviors that are informal, unplanned, and directed at someone\nwho is immediately present, but is not as good at prompting more abstractly-considered, long-term prosocial\nbehavior.\n[180]\nEmpathy can not only be a precursor to one's own helpful acts, but can also be a way of inviting help from\nothers. If you mimic the posture, facial expressions, and vocal style of someone you are with, you can\nthereby encourage them to help you and to form a favorable opinion of you.\n[181]\nIn the 2007 book The Ethics of Care and Empathy, philosopher Michael Slote introduces a theory of care-\nbased ethics that is grounded in empathy. He claims that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a\nbasis of empathic response, and that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by\nempathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy, and in turn morality, are natural. These\nnatural obligations include a greater empathic and moral obligation to family and friends and to those close\nto us in time and space. Our moral obligation to such people seems naturally stronger to us than that to\nstrangers at a distance. Slote explains that this is due to the natural process of empathy. He asserts that\nactions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for\nothers on the part of the agent.\n[182]\nIn phenomenology, empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without\nconfusion between self and other. This is based on the concept of agency. In the most basic sense,\nphenomenology is the experience of the other's body as \"my body over there.\" In most other respects,\nDisciplinary approaches\nPhilosophy\nEthics\nPhenomenology\n\nhowever, it is an experience viewed through the person's own eyes; in experiencing empathy, what is\nexperienced is not \"my\" experience, even though I experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the\ncondition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.\n[183]\nSome postmodernist historians such as Keith Jenkins have debated whether or not it is possible to\nempathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in\nthe present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant liberal discourse of modern society and\ncan be connected to John Stuart Mill's concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign\ncountry and as we do not have access to the epistemological conditions of bygone ages we are unable to\nempathize with those who lived then.\n[184]\nHeinz Kohut introduced the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of\ngathering unconscious material.\n[185]\nBecause empathy seems to have potential to improve customer relations, employee morale, and personnel\nmanagement capability, it has been studied in a business context.\nIn the 2009 book Wired to Care, strategy consultant Dev Patnaik argues that a major flaw in contemporary\nbusiness practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that without empathy people\ninside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions, and often get fooled into believing they understand\ntheir business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. He says that companies can create a sense of\nempathy for customers, pointing to Nike, Harley-Davidson, and IBM as examples of \"Open Empathy\nOrganizations\". Such companies, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to\nchange more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.\n[186]\nIn the 2011 book The Empathy Factor, organizational consultant Marie Miyashiro similarly argues for\nbringing empathy to the workplace, and suggests Nonviolent Communication as an effective mechanism for\nachieving this.\n[187]\nIn studies by the Management Research Group, empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical\nleadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model, and empathy was one of the three\nstrongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness.\n[188] \nThe leadership consulting firm Development\nDimensions International found in 2016 that 20% of U.S. employers offered empathy training to\nmanagers.\n[189] \nA study by the Center for Creative Leadership found empathy to be positively correlated to\njob performance among employees as well.\n[190]\nPatricia Moore pioneered using empathic techniques to better understand customers. For example, she used\nmakeup and prosthetics to simulate the experience of elderly people, and used the insights from this to\ninspire friendlier products for that customer segment.\n[191] \nDesign engineers at Ford Motor Company wore\nprosthetics to simulate pregnancy and old age, to help them design cars that would work better for such\nHistory\nPsychotherapy\nBusiness and management\n\ncustomers.\n[192] \nFidelity Investments trains its telephone customer service employees in a virtual reality app\nthat puts them in a (dramatized) customer's home so they can experience what it is like to be on the other\nside of their conversations.\n[193]\nEmpathic perspective-taking plays important roles in sustaining cooperation in human societies, as studied\nby evolutionary game theory. In game theoretical models, indirect reciprocity refers to the mechanism of\ncooperation based on moral reputations that are assigned to individuals based on their perceived adherence\na set of moral rules called social norms. It has been shown that if reputations are relative and individuals\ndisagree on the moral standing of others (for example, because they use different moral evaluation rules or\nmake errors of judgement), then cooperation will not be sustained. However, when individuals have the\ncapacity for empathic perspective-taking, altruistic behavior can once again evolve.\n[35] \nMoreover,\nevolutionary models also revealed that empathic perspective-taking itself can evolve, promoting prosocial\nbehavior in human populations.\n[194]\nAnother growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and\nlearners.\n[195] \nAlthough there is general agreement that empathy is essential in educational settings, research\nfound that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers.\n[196]\nLearning by teaching is one method used to teach empathy. Students transmit new content to their\nclassmates, so they have to reflect continuously on those classmates' mental processes. This develops the\nstudents' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective\npsychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or\ncaring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to\nhave. Other research and meta-analyses corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.\n[197]\nWithin medical education, a hidden curriculum appears to dampen or even reduce medical student\nempathy.\n[198]\nAccording to one theory, empathy is one of seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural\ncommunication. This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that people\nexperience more difficulty empathizing with others who are different from them in characteristics such as\nstatus, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, and age.\n[196]\nEvolution of cooperation\nIn educational contexts\nIn intercultural contexts\n\nTo build intercultural empathy in others, psychologists employ empathy training. Researchers William\nWeeks, Paul Pedersen, et al. state that people who develop intercultural empathy can interpret experiences\nor perspectives from more than one worldview.\n[199] \nIntercultural empathy can also improve self-awareness\nand critical awareness of one's own interaction style as conditioned by one's cultural views and promote a\nview of self-as-process.\n[200]\n‚ÄúThe greatest benefits we owe to the artist, whether painter, poet, or novelist, is the extension of\nour sympathies. Appeals founded on generalizations and statistics require a sympathy ready-\nmade, a moral sentiment already in activity; but a picture of human life such as a great artist can\ngive, surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves,\nwhich may be called the raw material of moral sentiment.‚Ä¶ Art is the nearest thing to life; it is a\nmode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the\nbounds of our personal lot.‚Äù\n‚Äî George Eliot\n[201]\nLynn Hunt argued in Inventing Human Rights: A History that the concept of human rights developed how\nit did and when it did in part as a result of the influence of mid-eighteenth-century European novelists,\nparticularly those whose use of the epistolatory novel form gave readers a more vivid sense that they were\ngaining access to the candid details of a real life. \"The epistolatory novel did not just reflect important\ncultural and social changes of the time. Novel reading actually helped create new kinds of feelings\nincluding a recognition of shared psychological experiences, and these feelings then translated into new\ncultural and social movements including human rights.\"\n[202]\nThe power of empathy has become a frequent ability in fiction, specifically in that of superhero media.\n\"Empaths\" have the ability to sense/feel the emotions and bodily sensations of others and, in some cases,\ninfluence or control them. Although sometimes a specific power held by specific characters such as the\nMarvel Comics character Empath, the power has also been frequently linked to that of telepathy such as in\nthe case of Jean Grey.\nThe rebooted television series Charmed portrays the character Maggie Vera as a witch with the power of\nempathy. Her powers later expand to allow her to control the emotions of others as well as occasionally\nconcentrate emotion into pure energy. In season four she learns to replicate people's powers by empathically\nunderstanding them.\nIn the 2013 NBC television show reinterpretation of Hannibal we are introduced in the first episode to Will\nGraham. Graham is unique in that he seems to have exceptionally high levels of both cognitive and\nemotional empathy, combined with an eidetic memory and imagination. These abilities help him understand\nthe motives of some of the most depraved killers. Hannibal Lecter calls his ability \"pure empathy\". Graham\nIn fiction\n\ncan assume the viewpoint of virtually anyone he meets, even viewpoints that sicken him. When evaluating\na crime scene, he uses his imagination and empathy to almost become the killer, feeling what they were\nfeeling during a murder.\nAgainst Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion (book by Paul Bloom)\nArtificial empathy\nAttribution (psychology)\nDigital empathy\nPhilip K.

Everyone sees its\nshapes from a different perspective\nengaging in perspective-taking.\n[16] \nThe two concepts are related but different: theory of mind is the\nrecognition that another person has different thoughts and feelings while perspective-taking is the ability to\ntake on that other person's point of view.\n[11]\nEmpathy has been defined as the ability to share the same emotions another person is having.\n[17] \nEmpathy\nand perspective-taking have been studied together in a variety of ways. There are not always clear lines of\ndistinction between empathy and perspective-taking; the two concepts are often studied in conjunction with\none another and viewed as related and similar. Some research distinguishes the two concepts and points out\ntheir differences,\n[1] \nwhile other literature theorizes that perspective-taking is one component of\nempathy.\n[12][18]\nStudies have assessed the age at which humans are capable of\nvisual perspective-taking, and have drawn different conclusions.\nIn 1956, Jean Piaget and B√§rbel Inhelder conducted a study to\nassess the visual perspective-taking abilities of young children. This\nstudy has come to be known as the three mountain problem.\n[2] \nIt\nfound that by the ages of nine to ten, children can successfully\ncomplete the three mountain problem and they seem able to\nunderstand that when someone is standing in a different location\n(i.e. on a different mountain top) they have a different view.\nHowever, children ages eight and under struggled with this task.\n[2]\nSince this classic study, a number of studies have suggested that\nvisual perspective-taking may be possible earlier than the age of nine.\n[19][20] \nFor example, a study that used\na different method to assess visual perspective-taking suggested that children may be able to successfully\nvisually perspective-take by the age of four and a half years old.\n[19] \nIn this study, four-and-a-half-year-old\nchildren were able to understand that someone sitting closer to a picture would have a better view of that\npicture. However, these researchers found that children who were three and three-and-a-half years old\nstruggled with this task which led them to conclude that the age range of three to four-and-a-half years old\ncould be crucial in perspective-taking development.\n[19]\nDevelopmental psychologist John H. Flavell suggested that there are two levels of visual perspective-taking\nthat emerge as children develop:\n[6]\n1. Level 1 perspective-taking is defined as the ability to understand that someone else may see\nthings differently and to understand what another person can see in physical space.\n[6] \nFor\nexample, one could understand that while an object may be obstructing their own view, from\nwhere another person is standing they can see a cat in the room.\n2. Level 2 perspective-taking is defined as the understanding that another person can see\nthings differently in physical space and to understand how those objects are organized from\nEmpathy\nIn development\nVisual\n\nthat other person's point of view.\n[6] \nFor example, a person can understand that from another\nperson's point of view they can see a dog to the right but from their own point of view the dog\nis to the left.\nStudies have examined when children are able to demonstrate level 1 and level 2 perspective-taking. These\nstudies have shown that children at 24 months old\n[21][22] \nand 14 months old\n[23] \nmay be able to engage in\nlevel 1 perspective-taking, and be able to understand various lines of sight depending on the position of a\nperson.\n[24][25] \nResearch also suggests that children can engage in level 2 perspective-taking as early as two\nand a half years old.\n[26]\nStudies also suggest that visual perspective-taking ability improves from childhood to adulthood.\n[27] \nFor\nexample, in comparing six-year-olds, eight-year-olds, ten-year-olds, and adults (averaging 19 years old)\nresearchers found that as people's age increases, visual perspective-taking tasks can be done with more\naccuracy and speed.\n[28]\nIn Piaget's theory of cognitive development, he suggests that perspective-taking begins in the concrete\noperational stage (third stage) which ranges from ages seven to twelve.\n[29] \nIn this stage the idea of\ndecentration is introduced as a cognitive ability (decentration is the ability to take into account the way\nothers perceive various aspects of a given situation).\n[29]\nAnother developmental perspective-taking theory was created by Robert L. Selman and called social\nperspective-taking theory (or Role-taking theory). This theory suggests that there are five developmental\nstages involved in perspective-taking ranging from ages three to six (characterized by egocentrism or an\ninability to think of things from another's point of view) to teenagers and adults (who can understand\nanother person's point of view and whose understanding is informed by recognizing another person's\nenvironment and culture).\n[30] \nThe theory suggests that as humans mature from childhood to adulthood their\nability to perspective-take improves. Studies by Selman and colleagues suggest that children can\nperspective-take in different ways at different ages.\n[31]\nOther studies assess that children can begin to take on the viewpoint of another person, considering their\nfeelings, thoughts, and attitudes, as four-year-olds.\n[14][32]\nAlthough the distinction between visual and cognitive perspective-taking is important, some authors claim\nthat all forms of perspective-taking rely on the same general ability, and different types of perspective-taking\ncorrelate.\n[33][34]\nWith respect to visual perspective-taking in adults, Tversky and Hard (2009) have shown that observers\ntend to use the point of view of another person when describing the spatial relations of objects.\n[35]\nProcessing other perspectives may be spontaneous, and according to some studies even automatic.\n[36]\nConceptual\nIn adults\n\nThere are also cases where we spontaneously evaluate what another person is seeing, but we make\nsystematic mistakes. A striking example is when a person in a scene is looking towards a mirror, we often\ninterpret that as if they are seeing themselves even when the layout makes it impossible. This phenomenon\nis known as the Venus effect\n[37]\nVisual perspective-taking studies that focus on brain regions are generally performed by collecting\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants perform perspective-taking tasks. For\nexample, a participant may be shown a picture of another person with objects around them and asked to\ntake on the viewpoint of that person and indicate the number of objects they see (Level 1 visual perspective-\ntaking) and if the objects are located to the right or left of the other person (level 2 visual perspective-\ntaking).\n[10] \nWhile the participant is completing this task they are also having an fMRI scan.\nA meta-analysis that looked at fMRI research on visual perspective-taking as of 2013 suggested that several\nareas of the brain have clustered activation during these perspective-taking tasks. These areas included the\nleft prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the left cerebellum.\n[10] \nStudies suggest these areas of the brain are\ninvolved in decision-making\n[38] \nvisual imagery,\n[39] \nand attention\n[40] \nrespectively.\nResearch also suggests that multiple brain areas are involved in conceptual perspective-taking. Studies have\nbeen conducted by administering a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and asking participants to\nengage in perspective-taking tasks. For example, in one study, participants who were all medical students\nwere asked to consider the knowledge base someone who was not in the medical field would have on a list\nof medical questions.\n[41]\nStudies suggest that regions that are activated during cognitive perspective-taking include the right parietal\nlobe and the posterior cingulate cortex among others.\n[41][42] \nSome areas seem to be involved both when\npeople imagine themselves and when they imagine the perspective of others. For example, when\nparticipants were asked to imagine themselves engaging in an activity versus imagining another person\nengaging in that activity the precuneus and the supplementary motor area (SMA) were activated, suggesting\nvisual imagery and motor movement thoughts were involved in both tasks.\n[42]\nBrain regions\nVisual\nConceptual\nDeficits\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\nResearch highlights that perspective-taking may be more difficult for some children who have attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) plus co-occurring conduct disorders. ADHD research has shown\nthat children with this diagnosis demonstrate impairments in attention and communication:\n[7] \nThey have a\nharder time taking on the viewpoint of others than children who do not.\n[8]\nEvidence suggests that children with autism may be able to engage in visual perspective-taking but have\ndifficulty engaging in conceptual perspective-taking.\n[43] \nFor example, a study that compared perspective-\ntaking scores in children who had been diagnosed with autism as compared to children who did not have\nthis diagnosis found no significant difference in scores on level 1 and level 2 visual perspective-taking.\nHowever, the study found it was much harder for autistic children to engage in conceptual perspective-\ntaking tasks.\n[9]\nSome studies have explored potential interventions that could help improve perspective-taking abilities in\nchildren with autism. They suggest that video may help teach perspective-taking skills in such\nchildren.\n[44][16] \nOne intervention study with autistic children found that showing the children a video of\nsomeone engaging in perspective-taking tasks and explaining their actions led to improved perspective-\ntaking ability.\n[16]\nAn abundance of literature links perspective-taking abilities with other behaviors. Much of this literature\nfocuses on conceptual perspective-taking.\n[14]\nConceptual perspective-taking gives one the ability to better understand the reason behind another person's\nactions. This also helps one engage in social conversations in an acceptable and friendly way.\nMany studies associate perspective-taking with empathy. Psychologist Mark Davis suggested that empathy\nconsists of multiple dimensions. To assess this, Davis developed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index\n(IRI).\n[12] \nThe IRI consists of four subscales: fantasy, empathic concern, personal distress, and perspective-\ntaking. The perspective-taking subscale asks participants to report how likely they are to engage in trying to\nsee things from another person's point of view.\n[12] \nStudies using this widely cited measure found that\nperspective-taking is associated with many prosocial behaviors. One study, which assessed cross-cultural\ndata in 63 countries using the IRI, concluded that perspective-taking and empathic concern was associated\nwith volunteerism and agreeableness as well as self-esteem and life satisfaction.\n[45]\nResearch suggests that perspective-taking leads to empathic concern.\n[46] \nThis research distinguishes\nbetween two different types of perspective-taking: thinking of how oneself would act, feel, and behave if\nplaced in someone else's situation and thinking of the way that another person thinks, feels, and behaves in\nAutism\nOutcomes\nBenefit\nEmpathy\n\ntheir own situation.\n[46] \nThe results of this research reveals that thinking of how another person behaves and\nfeels in their own situation leads to feelings of empathy. However, thinking of how one would behave in\nanother person's situation leads to feelings of empathy as well as of distress.\n[46]\nResearch also finds that in negotiations, taking on the perspective of another person and empathizing with\nthem may have differential outcomes . One study found that people who engaged in perspective-taking\nwere more effective in making a deal with another person and in finding innovative agreements that\nsatisfied both parties, as compared to those who empathized with someone else.\n[1]\nResearch reveals that perspective-taking is associated with sympathy toward others and prosocial behavior\nin children as young as 18 months old.\n[47] \nA study of sibling interactions found that toddlers who were\nolder siblings were more likely to help take care of their younger siblings when they demonstrated higher\nperspective-taking abilities.\n[48]\nPerspective-taking is also associated with creativity. It increases the amount of creative ideas generated in\nteam activities.\n[49] \nOne study suggests that perspective-taking leads to more creative and innovative ideas\nparticularly in participants who are internally driven to complete a task.\n[4]\nMany studies find potential benefits of perspective-taking on the perceptions of outgroup members . Studies\non perspective-taking and bias and stereotyping are generally done by asking participants to take the\nperspective of another person who is different from them in certain domains (i.e. asking young adult\nparticipants to take on the perspective of an elderly person or asking White participants to take on the\nperspective of a Black person seen in a photograph or video).\n[3] \nSuch studies show that perspective-taking\ncan lead to reduced stereotyping of outgroup members,\n[50] \nimproved attitudes towards others,\n[51] \nand\nincreased helping behavior of outgroup members . Perspective-taking can lead to reduced in-group\nfavoritism.\n[50] \nResearch on implicit (or unconscious) biases found that perspective-taking can reduce\nimplicit bias scores (as measured by the Implicit-association test) as well as more recognition of subtle\ndiscrimination.\n[3]\nResearch into differences between having a conversation with someone whom you agree with versus with\nsomeone with whom you disagree finds that participants who disagreed had enhanced perspective-taking\nability and could better remember the conversation.\n[52]\nSympathy and caring\nCreativity\nBias and stereotype reduction\nIn disagreements\nDrawbacks\n\nSome researchers suggest drawbacks to perspective-taking. For example, studies found that asking people\nto engage in perspective-taking tasks can lead to increased stereotyping of the target if the target is deemed\nas having more stereotypic qualities\n[53] \nand as adopting stereotypic behaviors of outgroup members.\n[54]\nStudies to assess if nonhuman animals can successfully engage in perspective-taking have not drawn\nconsistent conclusions. Many such studies assess perspective-taking by training animals on specific tasks or\nby measuring how consistently animals follow the eye gaze of humans. Being able to successfully follow\nanother's eye gaze could indicate that the animal is aware that the human is seeing and paying attention to\nsomething that is different from what they see.\n[55]\nA study of spider monkeys and capuchin monkeys found that these primates successfully performed eye\ngazing tasks. This led researchers to conclude that the monkeys demonstrated some ability to consider\nanother person's viewpoint.\n[55] \nHowever, another study found that Rhesus monkeys were unsuccessful at\nsuch eye gazing tasks.\n[56]\nStudies suggest that dogs have complex social understanding.\n[57] \nIn one study, researchers told a dog it was\nnot allowed to eat a treat and then placed the treat in a location that the dog could reach.\n[5] \nDogs were more\nlikely to eat the treat after being instructed not to if there was a barrier that hid the dog from the instructor.\nDogs were less likely to eat the treat if the barrier was of smaller size or had a window in it. This study also\nshowed that dogs struggled in other tasks that focused on the dog's own visual attention. These researchers\nsuggest that this study provides evidence that dogs may be aware of other's visual perspectives.\n[5]\nRole reversal\nRole-taking theory\nTheory of mind\n1.

A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others' beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and\nthoughts may be different from one's own.\n[1] \nPossessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in\neveryday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring\nothers' behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with\nanimals and infants.\n[2] \nFactors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive\ndelays, age, and culture can affect a person's capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is\nsimilar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy\n[3] \nor sympathy.\nIt has been proposed that deficits in theory of mind can occur in people with autism,\n[5] \nanorexia nervosa,\n[6]\nschizophrenia, dysphoria, cocaine addiction,\n[7] \nand brain damage caused by alcohol's neurotoxicity.\n[8][9]\nNeuroimaging shows that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior superior temporal sulcus\n(pSTS), the precuneus, and the amygdala are associated with theory of mind tasks. Patients with frontal\nlobe or temporoparietal junction lesions find some theory of mind tasks difficult. One's theory of mind\ndevelops in childhood as the prefrontal cortex develops. It has been argued that children in a culture of\ncollectivism develop knowledge access earlier and understand diverse beliefs later than Western children in\na culture of individualism.\n[10]\nThe \"theory of mind\" is described as a theory, because the behavior of the other person, such as their\nstatements and expressions, is the only thing being directly observed; no one has direct access to the mind\nof another, and the existence and nature of the mind must be inferred.\n[11] \nIt is typically assumed others have\nminds analogous to one's own; this assumption is based on three reciprocal social interactions, as observed\nin joint attention,\n[2] \nthe functional use of language,\n[12] \nand the understanding of others' emotions and\nactions.\n[13] \nTheory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or\nexplain their actions, and to posit their intentions. It enables one to understand that mental states can be the\ncause of‚Äîand can be used to explain and predict‚Äîthe behavior of others.\n[11] \nBeing able to attribute mental\nstates to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, one must be able to conceive\nof the mind as a \"generator of representations\".\n[14] \nIf a person does not have a mature theory of mind, it\nmay be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.\n[15]\nTheory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience\nover many years for its full development. Different people may develop more or less effective theories of\nmind. Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a\nbroader hypercognitive ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.\n[16]\nEmpathy‚Äîthe recognition and understanding of the states of mind of others, including their beliefs, desires,\nand particularly emotions‚Äîis a related concept. Empathy is often characterized as the ability to \"put oneself\ninto another's shoes\". Recent neuro-ethological studies of animal behavior suggest that rodents may exhibit\nDefinition\n\nempathetic abilities.\n[17] \nWhile empathy is known as emotional perspective-taking, theory of mind is defined\nas cognitive perspective-taking.\n[18]\nResearch on theory of mind, in humans and animals, adults and children, normally and atypically\ndeveloping, has grown rapidly in the years since Premack and Guy Woodruff's 1978 paper, \"Does the\nchimpanzee have a theory of mind?\".\n[11] \nThe field of social neuroscience has also begun to address this\ndebate by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks that require the understanding of an\nintention, belief, or other mental state in others.\nAn alternative account of theory of mind is given in operant psychology and provides empirical evidence\nfor a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is\nfounded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within relational frame theory.\nDerived relational responding relies on the ability to identify derived relations, or relationships between\nstimuli that are not directly learned or reinforced; for example, if \"snake\" is related to \"danger\" and\n\"danger\" is related to \"fear\", people may know to fear snakes even without learning an explicit connection\nbetween snakes and fear.\n[19] \nAccording to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex\nset of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more\ncomplex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.\n[20][21][22]\nDiscussions of theory of mind have their roots in philosophical debate from the time of Ren√© Descartes'\nSecond Meditation, which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind.\nTwo contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature to theory of mind are theory-theory and\nsimulation theory. The theory-theorist posits a veritable theory‚Äî\"folk psychology\"‚Äîthat people use to\nreason about others' minds. Such a theory is developed automatically and innately, though it is instantiated\nthrough social interactions.\n[23] \nIt is also closely related to person perception and attribution theory from\nsocial psychology.\nIt is common and intuitive to assume that others are minded. People anthropomorphize non-human animals,\ninanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. Daniel Dennett referred to this tendency as taking an\n\"intentional stance\" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict their future behavior.\n[24]\nHowever, there is an important distinction between taking an \"intentional stance\" toward something and\nentering a \"shared world\" with it. The intentional stance is a functional relationship, describing the use of a\ntheory due to its practical utility, rather than the accuracy of its representation of the world. As such, it is\nsomething people resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its\nexistence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just a lens, through which the perceiver views the\nworld; it in many ways constitutes the cognition, as both its object and the blueprint used to structure\nperception into understanding.\nThe philosophical roots of another perspective, the relational frame theory (RFT) account of theory of mind,\narise from contextual psychology, which refers to the study of organisms (both human and non-human)\ninteracting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism,\na philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical\nPhilosophical and psychological roots\n\ncontext and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of\ncontextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of\ncontextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.\n[25]\nThe study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the\ndevelopment of this ability in human ontogeny and phylogeny, identifies several behavioral precursors to\ntheory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with\nothers are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later\nbecomes a full-fledged theory.\nSimon Baron-Cohen proposed that infants' understanding of attention in others acts as a critical precursor to\nthe development of theory of mind.\n[2] \nUnderstanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be\ndirected selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can\ninduce beliefs. A possible illustration of theory of mind in infants is joint attention. Joint attention refers to\nwhen two people look at and attend to the same thing. Parents often use the act of pointing to prompt\ninfants to engage in joint attention; understanding this prompt requires that infants take into account another\nperson's mental state and understand that the person notices an object or finds it of interest. Baron-Cohen\nspeculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest, via pointing,\n(\"Proto declarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention of another, may be the\nunderlying motive behind all human communication.\n[2]\nUnderstanding others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because\nintentionality is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The \"intentional stance\" was defined by\nDaniel Dennett\n[26] \nas an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs\nor desires. Both two and three-year-old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally or\naccidentally marked a box with stickers.\n[27] \nEven earlier in development, Andrew N. Meltzoff found that\n18-month-old infants could perform target tasks involving the manipulation of objects that adult\nexperimenters attempted and failed, suggesting the infants could represent the object-manipulating behavior\nof adults as involving goals and intentions.\n[28] \nWhile attribution of intention and knowledge is investigated\nin young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind, Gagliardi et al. have\npointed out that even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective\n(i.e., based on attribution of knowledge to others).\n[29] \nIn their experiment, adult human subjects attempted\nto choose the container baited with a small object from a selection of four containers when guided by\nconfederates who could not see which container was baited.\nResearch in developmental psychology suggests that an infant's ability to imitate others lies at the origins of\nboth theory of mind and other social-cognitive achievements like perspective-taking and empathy.\n[30]\nAccording to Meltzoff, the infant's innate understanding that others are \"like me\" allows them to recognize\nthe equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self. For\nexample, the infant uses their own experiences, orienting their head and eyes toward an object of interest to\nunderstand the movements of others who turn toward an object; that is, they will generally attend to objects\nof interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put too much\nweight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and\nempathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra\nDevelopment\n\nHorowitz found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than\nchildren did. Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and\ncannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.\n[31]\nWhile much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood\nand into late adolescence as the synapses in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought\nto be involved in planning and decision-making.\n[32] \nChildren seem to develop theory of mind skills\nsequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children\nare able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that\nothers have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may\nhave false beliefs and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general\ntrend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to\nmore valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in\nindividualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that\nothers have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as\nimportant and therefore may not develop until later.\n[33]\nThere is evidence that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development\nin humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on\ntheory of mind and language tasks.\n[34] \nBoth language and theory of mind begin to develop around the same\ntime in children (between ages two and five), but many other abilities develop during this same time period\nas well, and they do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind.\nPragmatic theories of communication assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and\nmental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to\nconvey.\n[35] \nSince spoken phrases can have different meanings depending on context, theory of mind can\nplay a crucial role in understanding the intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some\nempirical results suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-\nreading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners,\nwhich implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.\n[36]\nCarol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. Perhaps the extent of verbal\ncommunication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development.\nSuch language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of\nothers.\n[37] \nEmpirical findings indicate that participation in family discussion predicts scores on theory of\nmind tasks,\n[38] \nand that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with\ntheir parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.\n[39]\nAnother explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a\nchild's understanding of mental-state words such as \"think\" and \"believe\". Since a mental state is not\nsomething that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental\nstates from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and\npragmatics of a language.\n[37] \nStudies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts\ntheory of mind in four-year-olds.\n[40]\nLanguage\n\nA third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence (\"Jimmy thinks the world is flat\") from\nits embedded complement (\"the world is flat\") and understand that one can be true while the other can be\nfalse is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these complements as being independent of one\nanother is a relatively complex syntactic skill and correlates with increased scores on theory of mind tasks in\nchildren.\n[41]\nThere is also evidence that the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely\nconnected. The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well\nas to perceive and reproduce words. The TPJ also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces,\nvoices, and biological motion, and in theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together,\nit is reasonable to suspect that they work together. Studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ\nwhen patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples' beliefs but not\nwhile observing information about physical control stimuli.\n[42]\nNeurotypical adults have theory of mind concepts that they developed as children (concepts such as belief,\ndesire, knowledge, and intention). They use these concepts to meet the diverse demands of social life,\nranging from snap decisions about how to trick an opponent in a competitive game, to keeping up with who\nknows what in a fast-moving conversation, to judging the guilt or innocence of the accused in a court of\nlaw.\n[43]\nBoaz Keysar, Dale Barr, and colleagues found that adults often failed to use their theory of mind abilities to\ninterpret a speaker's message, and acted as if unaware that the speaker lacked critical knowledge about a\ntask. In one study, a confederate instructed adult participants to rearrange objects, some of which were not\nvisible to the confederate, as part of a communication game. Only objects that were visible to both the\nconfederate and the participant were part of the game. Despite knowing that the confederate could not see\nsome of the objects, a third of the participants still tried to move those objects.\n[44] \nOther studies show that\nadults are prone to egocentric biases, with which they are influenced by their own beliefs, knowledge, or\npreferences when judging those of other people, or that they neglect other people's perspectives entirely.\n[45]\nThere is also evidence that adults with greater memory, inhibitory capacity, and motivation are more likely\nto use their theory of mind abilities.\n[46]\nIn contrast, evidence about indirect effects of thinking about other people's mental states suggests that adults\nmay sometimes use their theory of mind automatically. Agnes Kovacs and colleagues measured the time it\ntook adults to detect the presence of a ball as it was revealed from behind an occluder. They found that\nadults' speed of response was influenced by whether another person (the \"agent\") in the scene thought there\nwas a ball behind the occluder, even though adults were not asked to pay attention to what the agent\nthought.\n[47]\nDana Samson and colleagues measured the time it took adults to judge the number of dots on the wall of a\nroom. They found that adults responded more slowly when another person standing in the room happened\nto see fewer dots than they did, even when they had never been asked to pay attention to what the person\ncould see.\n[48] \nIt has been questioned whether these \"altercentric biases\" truly reflect automatic processing of\nwhat another person is thinking or seeing or, instead, reflect attention and memory effects cued by the other\nperson, but not involving any representation of what they think or see.\n[49]\nTheory of mind in adults\n\nDifferent theories seek to explain such results. If theory of mind is automatic, this would help explain how\npeople keep up with the theory of mind demands of competitive games and fast-moving conversations. It\nmight also explain evidence that human infants and some non-human species sometimes appear capable of\ntheory of mind, despite their limited resources for memory and cognitive control.\n[50] \nIf theory of mind is\neffortful and not automatic, on the other hand, this explains why it feels effortful to decide whether a\ndefendant is guilty or whether a negotiator is bluffing. Economy of effort would help explain why people\nsometimes neglect to use their theory of mind.\nIan Apperly and Stephen Butterfill suggested that people have \"two systems\" for theory of mind,\n[51] \nin\ncommon with \"two systems\" accounts in many other areas of psychology.\n[52] \nIn this account, \"system 1\" is\ncognitively efficient and enables theory of mind for a limited but useful set of circumstances. \"System 2\" is\ncognitively effortful, but enables much more flexible theory of mind abilities. Philosopher Peter Carruthers\ndisagrees, arguing that the same core theory of mind abilities can be used in both simple and complex\nways.\n[53] \nThe account has been criticized by Celia Heyes who suggests that \"system 1\" theory of mind\nabilities do not require representation of mental states of other people, and so are better thought of as \"sub-\nmentalizing\".\n[49]\nIn older age, theory of mind capacities decline, irrespective of how exactly they are tested.\n[54] \nHowever, the\ndecline in other cognitive functions is even stronger, suggesting that social cognition is better preserved. In\ncontrast to theory of mind, empathy shows no impairments in aging.\n[55][56]\nThere are two kinds of theory of mind representations: cognitive (concerning mental states, beliefs,\nthoughts, and intentions) and affective (concerning the emotions of others). Cognitive theory of mind is\nfurther separated into first order (e.g., I think she thinks that) and second order (e.g. he thinks that she thinks\nthat). There is evidence that cognitive and affective theory of mind processes are functionally independent\nfrom one another.\n[57] \nIn studies of Alzheimer's disease, which typically occurs in older adults, patients\ndisplay impairment with second order cognitive theory of mind, but usually not with first order cognitive or\naffective theory of mind. However, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to\nage. There have been many discrepancies in the data collected thus far, likely due to small sample sizes and\nthe use of different tasks that only explore one aspect of theory of mind. Many researchers suggest that\ntheory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function.\n[58]\nResearchers propose that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between\nthe ages of three and five:\n[59] \ndiverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access, false beliefs, and hidden\nemotions.\n[59] \nAustralian, American, and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order,\n[10]\nand studies with children in Canada, India, Peru, Samoa, and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false\nbelief task at around the same time, suggesting that children develop theory of mind consistently around the\nworld.\n[60]\nHowever, children from Iran and China develop theory of mind in a slightly different order. Although they\nbegin the development of theory of mind around the same time, toddlers from these countries understand\nknowledge access before Western children but take longer to understand diverse beliefs.\n[10][15] \nResearchers\nbelieve this swap in the developmental order is related to the culture of collectivism in Iran and China,\nAging\nCultural variations\n\nwhich emphasizes interdependence and shared knowledge as opposed to the culture of individualism in\nWestern countries, which promotes individuality and accepts differing opinions. Because of these different\ncultural values, Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have\ndifferent beliefs and opinions. This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and\nsolely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors.\n[10]\nTheory of mind can help historians to more properly understand historical figures' characters, for example\nThomas Jefferson. Emancipationists like Douglas L. Wilson and scholars at the Thomas Jefferson\nFoundation view Jefferson as an opponent of slavery all his life, noting Jefferson's attempts within the\nlimited range of options available to him to undermine slavery, his many attempts at abolition legislation, the\nmanner in which he provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment. This view\ncontrasts with that of revisionists like Paul Finkelman, who criticizes Jefferson for racism, slavery, and\nhypocrisy. Emancipationist views on this hypocrisy recognize that if he tried to be true to his word, it would\nhave alienated his fellow Virginians. In another example, Franklin D. Roosevelt did not join NAACP\nleaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation, as he believed that such legislation was unlikely to\npass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen, including many of Roosevelt's fellow\nDemocrats.\nWhether children younger than three or four years old have a theory of mind is a topic of debate among\nresearchers. It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children\nunderstand about others and the world. Tasks used in research into the development of theory of mind must\ntake into account the \numwelt\n[61] \nof the pre-verbal child.\nOne of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is the ability to attribute false belief: in\nother words, to understand that other people can believe things which are not true. To do this, it is\nsuggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their\nknowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their\nmental states. Numerous versions of false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task created\nby Wimmer and Perner (1983).\n[62]\nIn the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the Sally-Anne test), children are told a\nstory about Sally and Anne. Sally has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room.\nWhile she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. The child\nbeing tested is then asked where Sally will look for the marble once she returns. The child passes the task if\nshe answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she\nanswers that Sally will look in the box. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's\nmental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict\nbehavior based on that understanding.\n[63] \nAnother example depicts a boy who leaves chocolate on a shelf\nand then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that\nthe boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.\n[64]\nHistoriography\nEmpirical investigation\nFalse-belief task\n\nThe results of research using false-belief tasks have been fairly consistent: most typically developing\nchildren are able to pass the tasks from around age four.\n[65] \nWhile most children, including those with\nDown syndrome, are able to pass this test, in one study, 80% of children diagnosed with autism were\nunable to do so.\n[66] \nHowever, several later studies did not replicate this result.\n[67][68][69][70]\nAdults may also struggle with false beliefs, for instance when they show hindsight bias.\n[71] \nIn one\nexperiment, adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard\ninformation on actual outcome. Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others'\nthinking, adults can fail to correctly disregard certain information that they have been given.\n[64]\nOther tasks have been developed to try to extend the false-belief task. In the \"unexpected contents\" or\n\"smarties\" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as\nthough it holds Smarties. After the child guesses \"Smarties\", it is shown that the box in fact contained\npencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who\nhas not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she\nresponds that another person will think that \"Smarties\" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that\nanother person will think that the box contains pencils. Gopnik & Astington found that children pass this\ntest at age four or five years.\n[72]\nThe \"false-photograph\" task\n[73] \nalso measures theory of mind development. In this task, children must\nreason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs. Within the\nfalse-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists.\n[74] \nIn the location-change task, the\nexaminer puts an object in one location (e.g. chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child\ntakes a Polaroid photograph of the scene. While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the\nobject to a different location (e.g. a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action. The\nexaminer asks the child two control questions: \"When we first took the picture, where was the object?\" and\n\"Where is the object now?\" The subject is also asked a \"false-photograph\" question: \"Where is the object in\nthe picture?\" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture\nand the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be\nmisinterpreted as \"Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?\" and therefore some examiners\nuse an alternative phrasing.\n[75]\nTo make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical autism to understand and\nperform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-\nemphasized: some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the\nexaminer, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the\nsubject, and some that meet both of those standards. One category of tasks uses a preferential-looking\nparadigm, with looking time as the dependent variable. For instance, nine-month-old infants prefer looking\nUnexpected contents\nOther tasks\n\nat behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.\n[76] \nOther\nparadigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed\nacts,\n[28] \nand rates of pretend play.\n[77]\nResearch on the early precursors of theory of mind has invented ways to observe preverbal infants'\nunderstanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of\nexperimental procedures, studies show that infants from their first year of life have an implicit understanding\nof what other people see\n[78] \nand what they know.\n[79][80] \nA popular paradigm used to study infants' theory\nof mind is the violation-of-expectation procedure, which exploits infants' tendency to look longer at\nunexpected and surprising events compared to familiar and expected events. The amount of time they look\nat an event gives researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding\nof events. One study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person\nwhose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\", compared to someone whose visual\nperception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited\nvocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or\nan absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in\nan object-search task, the same persons searching for a toy either in the correct or incorrect location after\nthey both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker\nwere surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location\ncompared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable\nlooker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can\ndifferentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual\nperception.\n[81]\nWith the methods used to test theory of mind, it has been experimentally shown that very simple robots that\nonly react by reflexes and are not built to have any complex cognition at all can pass the tests for having\ntheory of mind abilities that psychology textbooks assume to be exclusive to humans older than four or five\nyears. Whether such a robot passes the test is influenced by completely non-cognitive factors such as\nplacement of objects and the structure of the robot body influencing how the reflexes are conducted. It has\ntherefore been suggested that theory of mind tests may not actually test cognitive abilities.\n[82]\nFurthermore, early research into theory of mind in autistic children\n[66] \nis argued to constitute\nepistemological violence due to implicit or explicit negative and universal conclusions about autistic\nindividuals being drawn from empirical data that viably supports other (non-universal) conclusions.\n[83]\nTheory of mind impairment, or mind-blindness, describes a difficulty someone would have with\nperspective-taking. Individuals with theory of mind impairment struggle to see phenomena from any other\nperspective than their own.\n[84] \nIndividuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty\ndetermining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a\ndifficult time with social reciprocity.\n[85] \nTheory of mind deficits have been observed in people with autism\nEarly precursors\nMethodological problems\nDeficits\n\nspectrum disorders, schizophrenia, nonverbal learning disorder and along with people under the influence\nof alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived people, and people who are experiencing severe emotional or\nphysical pain. Theory of mind deficits have also been observed in deaf children who are late signers (i.e. are\nborn to hearing parents), but such a deficit is due to the delay in language learning, not any cognitive deficit,\nand therefore disappears once the child learns sign language.\n[86]\nIn 1985 Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie, and Uta Frith suggested that children with autism do not\nemploy theory of mind and that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to\nunderstand another person's beliefs.\n[66] \nThese difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills\nand they have been taken as a key feature of autism.\n[87] \nAlthough in a 2019 review, Gernsbacher and\nYergeau argued that \"the claim that autistic people lack a theory of mind is empirically questionable\", as\nthere have been numerous failed replications of classic ToM studies and the meta-analytical effect sizes of\nsuch replications were minimal to small.\n[67]\nMany individuals classified as autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others, and some\nseem to lack theory of mind capabilities.\n[88] \nResearchers who study the relationship between autism and\ntheory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways. One account assumes that theory of\nmind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play.\n[89] \nAccording to\nLeslie,\n[89] \ntheory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts, beliefs, and desires, regardless of\nwhether the circumstances involved are real. This might explain why some autistic individuals show\nextreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective\njustification,\n[90] \nin which deficits in theory of mind in autistic people result from a distortion in\nunderstanding and responding to emotions. He suggests that typically developing individuals, unlike autistic\nindividuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend\nand react to other people's feelings. Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental\ndelay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different\nstages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may\nlead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.\n[88]\nIt has been speculated that theory of mind exists on a continuum as opposed to the traditional view of a\ndiscrete presence or absence.\n[77] \nWhile some research has suggested that some autistic populations are\nunable to attribute mental states to others,\n[2] \nrecent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms\nthat facilitate the attribution of mental states.\n[91] \nA binary view regarding theory of mind contributes to the\nstigmatization of autistic adults who do possess perspective-taking capacity, as the assumption that autistic\npeople do not have empathy can become a rationale for dehumanization.\n[92]\nTine et al. report that autistic children score substantially lower on measures of social theory of mind (i.e.,\n\"reasoning about others' mental states\", p. 1) in comparison to children diagnosed with Asperger\nsyndrome.\n[93]\nGenerally, children with more advanced theory of mind abilities display more advanced social skills, greater\nadaptability to new situations, and greater cooperation with others. As a result, these children are typically\nwell-liked. However, \"children may use their mind-reading abilities to manipulate, outwit, tease, or trick\ntheir peers.\"\n[94] \nIndividuals possessing inferior theory of mind skills, such as children with autism spectrum\nAutism\n\ndisorder, may be socially rejected by their peers since they are unable to communicate effectively. Social\nrejection has been proven to negatively impact a child's development and can put the child at greater risk of\ndeveloping depressive symptoms.\n[95]\nPeer-mediated interventions (PMI) are a school-based treatment approach for children and adolescents with\nautism spectrum disorder in which peers are trained to be role models in order to promote social behavior.\nLaghi et al. studied whether analysis of prosocial (nice) and antisocial (nasty) theory-of-mind behaviors\ncould be used, in addition to teacher recommendations, to select appropriate candidates for PMI programs.\nSelecting children with advanced theory-of-mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically\nmake the program more effective. While the results indicated that analyzing the social uses of theory of\nmind of possible candidates for a PMI program may increase the program's efficacy, it may not be a good\npredictor of a candidate's performance as a role model.\n[32]\nA 2014 Cochrane review on interventions based on theory of mind found that such a theory could be taught\nto individuals with autism but claimed little evidence of skill maintenance, generalization to other settings,\nor development effects on related skills.\n[96]\nSome 21st century studies have shown that the results of some studies of theory of mind tests on autistic\npeople may be misinterpreted based on the double empathy problem, which proposes that rather than\nautistic people specifically having trouble with theory of mind, autistic people and non-autistic people have\nequal difficulty understanding one-another due to their neurological differences.\n[97] \nStudies have shown\nthat autistic adults perform better in theory of mind tests when paired with other autistic adults\n[98] \nas well as\npossibly autistic close family members.\n[99] \nAcademics who acknowledge the double empathy problem also\npropose that it is likely autistic people understand non-autistic people to a higher degree than vice-versa, due\nto the necessity of functioning in a non-autistic society.\n[100]\nPsychopathy is another deficit that is of large importance when discussing theory of mind. While\npsychopathic individuals show impaired emotional behavior including a lack of emotional responsiveness to\nothers and deficient empathy, as well as impaired social behavior, there are many controversies regarding\npsychopathic individuals' theory of mind.\n[101] \nMany different studies provide contradictory information on\na correlation between theory of mind impairment and psychopathic individuals.\nThere have been some speculations made about the similarities between individuals with autism and\npsychopathic individuals in the theory of mind performance. In this study in 2008, the Happ√©'s advanced\ntest of theory of mind was presented to a group of 25 psychopaths, and 25 non-psychopaths incarcerated.\nThis test showed that there wasn‚Äôt a difference in the performance of the task for the psychopaths and non-\npsychopaths. However, they were able to see that the psychopaths were performing significantly better than\nthe most highly able adult autistic population.\n[102] \nThis shows that there is not a similarity between\nindividuals with autism and psychopathic individuals.\nThere have been repetitive suggestions regarding the possibility that a deficient or biased grasp of others‚Äô\nmental states, or theory of mind, could potentially contribute to antisocial behavior, aggression, and\npsychopathy.\n[103] \nIn one study named ‚ÄòReading the Mind in the Eyes‚Äô, the participants view photographs of\nan individual‚Äôs eye and had to attribute a mental state, or emotion, to the individual. This is an interesting\ntest because Magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that this task produced increased activity in the\ndorsolateral prefrontal and the left medial frontal cortices, the superior temporal gyrus, and the left\nPsychopathy\n\namygdala. There is extensive literature suggesting amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy however, this test\nshows that both groups of psychopathic and non-psychopathic adults performed equally well on the\ntest.\n[103] \nThus, disregarding that there isn‚Äôt Theory of Mind impairment in psychopathic individuals.\nIn another study using a systemic review and meta-analysis, data was gathered from 42 different studies and\nfound that psychopathic traits are associated with impairment in the theory of mind task performance. This\nrelationship was not regulated by age, population, psychopathy measurement (self-report versus clinical\nchecklist) or theory of mind task type (cognitive versus affective).\n[104] \nThis study used past studies to show\nthat there is a relationship between psychopathic individuals and theory of mind impairments.\nIn 2009 a study was conducted to test whether impairment in the emotional aspects of theory of mind rather\nthat the general theory of mind abilities may account for some of the impaired social behavior in\npsychopathy.\n[101] \nThis study involved criminal offenders diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder\nwho had high psychopathy features, participants with localized lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex,\nparticipants with non-frontal lesions, and healthy control subjects. Subjects were tested with a task that\nexamines affective versus cognitive theory of mind. They found that the individuals with psychopathy and\nthose with orbitofrontal cortex lesions were both impaired on the affective theory of mind but not in\ncognitive theory of mind when compared to the control group.\n[101]\nIndividuals diagnosed with schizophrenia can show deficits in theory of mind. Mirjam Sprong and\ncolleagues investigated the impairment by examining 29 different studies, with a total of over 1500\nparticipants.\n[105] \nThis meta-analysis showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with\nschizophrenia. They performed poorly on false-belief tasks, which test the ability to understand that others\ncan hold false beliefs about events in the world, and also on intention-inference tasks, which assess the\nability to infer a character's intention from reading a short story. Schizophrenia patients with negative\nsymptoms, such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and\nare unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also\nperform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions. The meta-analysis\nadditionally showed that IQ, gender, and age of the participants do not significantly affect the performance\nof theory of mind tasks.\n[105]\nResearch suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight‚Äîthe patient's\nawareness of their mental illness.\n[106] \nInsight requires theory of mind; a patient must be able to adopt a\nthird-person perspective and see the self as others do.\n[107] \nA patient with good insight can accurately self-\nrepresent, by comparing himself with others and by viewing himself from the perspective of others.\n[106]\nInsight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms. A patient who lacks insight\ndoes not realize that he has a mental illness, because of his inability to accurately self-represent. Therapies\nthat teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues\nand taking the perspective of another person.\n[106]\nResearch indicates that theory-of-mind deficit is a stable trait-characteristic rather than a state-characteristic\nof schizophrenia.\n[108] \nThe meta-analysis conducted by Sprong et al. showed that patients in remission still\nhad impairment in theory of mind. This indicates that the deficit is not merely a consequence of the active\nphase of schizophrenia.\n[105]\nSchizophrenia\n\nSchizophrenic patients' deficit in theory of mind impairs their interactions with others. Theory of mind is\nparticularly important for parents, who must understand the thoughts and behaviors of their children and\nreact accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the\nability to understand another person's thoughts, and in the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer\nwhat one person thinks about another person's thoughts.\n[109] \nCompared with healthy mothers, mothers with\nschizophrenia are found to be more remote, quiet, self-absorbed, insensitive, unresponsive, and to have\nfewer satisfying interactions with their children.\n[109] \nThey also tend to misinterpret their children's\nemotional cues, and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative.\n[109] \nActivities such as role-playing and\nindividual or group-based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective-\ntaking and theory of mind.\n[109] \nThere is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental\nrole dysfunction.\nImpairments in theory of mind, as well as other social-cognitive deficits, are commonly found in people\nwho have alcohol use disorders, due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, particularly the\nprefrontal cortex.\n[8]\nIndividuals in a major depressive episode, a disorder characterized by social impairment, show deficits in\ntheory of mind decoding.\n[110] \nTheory of mind decoding is the ability to use information available in the\nimmediate environment (e.g., facial expression, tone of voice, body posture) to accurately label the mental\nstates of others. The opposite pattern, enhanced theory of mind, is observed in individuals vulnerable to\ndepression, including those individuals with past major depressive\n disorder (MDD),\n[111] \ndysphoric\nindividuals,\n[112] \nand individuals with a maternal history of MDD.\n[113]\nChildren diagnosed with developmental language disorder (DLD) exhibit much lower scores on reading\nand writing sections of standardized tests, yet have a normal nonverbal IQ. These language deficits can be\nany specific deficits in lexical semantics, syntax, or pragmatics, or a combination of multiple problems.\nSuch children often exhibit poorer social skills than normally developing children, and seem to have\nproblems decoding beliefs in others. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that children with DLD have\nsubstantially lower scores on theory of mind tasks compared to typically developing children.\n[114] \nThis\nstrengthens the claim that language development is related to theory of mind.\nResearch on theory of mind in autism led to the view that mentalizing abilities are subserved by dedicated\nmechanisms that can‚Äîin some cases‚Äîbe impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact.\nAlcohol use disorders\nDepression and dysphoria\nDevelopmental language disorder\nBrain mechanisms\nIn neurotypical people\n\nNeuroimaging research supports this view, demonstrating specific brain regions are consistently engaged\nduring theory of mind tasks. Positron emission tomography (PET) research on theory of mind, using verbal\nand pictorial story comprehension tasks, identifies a set of brain regions including the medial prefrontal\ncortex (mPFC), and area around posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and sometimes precuneus and\namygdala/temporopolar cortex.\n[115][116] \nResearch on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified,\nwith separate lines of research focusing on the understanding of beliefs, intentions, and more complex\nproperties of minds such as psychological traits.\nStudies from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task contrast aimed at\nisolating the mentalizing component of the false-belief task, have consistently found activation in the mPFC,\nprecuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized.\n[117][118] \nIn particular, Saxe et al. proposed\nthat the right TPJ (rTPJ) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others.\n[119] \nSome debate\nexists, as the same rTPJ region is consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual\nattention;\n[120][121] \nJean Decety from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard thus\npropose that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and\nattentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, it is possible that\nthe observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be\ndue to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies\nmay not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these\nprocesses. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and\nshowed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6‚Äì10 mm above the peak for\nrepresenting beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process,\nthey found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space.\n[122]\nUsing single-cell recordings in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), researchers at MGH\nidentified neurons that encode information about others' beliefs, which were distinct from self-beliefs, across\ndifferent scenarios in a false-belief task. They further showed that these neurons could provide detailed\ninformation about others' beliefs, and could accurately predict these beliefs' verity.\n[123] \nThese findings\nsuggest a prominent role of distinct neuronal populations in the dmPFC in theory of mind complemented by\nthe TPJ and pSTS.\nFunctional imaging also illuminates the detection of mental state information in animations of moving\ngeometric shapes similar to those used in Heider and Simmel (1944),\n[124] \nwhich typical humans\nautomatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion. Three studies found\nremarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or\ndeterministic motion control: mPFC, pSTS, fusiform face area (FFA), and amygdala were selectively\nengaged during the theory of mind condition.\n[125] \nAnother study presented subjects with an animation of\ntwo dots moving with a parameterized degree of intentionality (quantifying the extent to which the dots\nchased each other), and found that pSTS activation correlated with this parameter.\n[126]\nA separate body of research implicates the posterior superior temporal sulcus in the perception of\nintentionality in human action. This area is also involved in perceiving biological motion, including body,\neye, mouth, and point-light display motion.\n[127] \nOne study found increased pSTS activation while watching\na human lift his hand versus having his hand pushed up by a piston (intentional versus unintentional\naction).\n[128] \nSeveral studies found increased pSTS activation when subjects perceive a human action that is\nincongruent with the action expected from the actor's context and inferred intention. Examples would be: a\nhuman performing a reach-to-grasp motion on empty space next to an object, versus grasping the\n\nobject;\n[129] \na human shifting eye gaze toward empty space next to a checkerboard target versus shifting\ngaze toward the target;\n[130] \nan unladen human turning on a light with his knee, versus turning on a light\nwith his knee while carrying a pile of books;\n[131] \nand a walking human pausing as he passes behind a\nbookshelf, versus walking at a constant speed.\n[132] \nIn these studies, actions in the \"congruent\" case have a\nstraightforward goal, and are easy to explain in terms of the actor's intention. The incongruent actions, on\nthe other hand, require further explanation (why would someone twist empty space next to a gear?), and\napparently demand more processing in the STS. This region is distinct from the temporoparietal area\nactivated during false belief tasks.\n[132] \npSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-\nlateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also\nright-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and\nthe FFA response to faces.\nNeuropsychological evidence supports neuroimaging results regarding the neural basis of theory of mind.\nStudies with patients with a lesion of the frontal lobes and the temporoparietal junction of the brain\n(between the temporal lobe and parietal lobe) report that they have difficulty with some theory of mind\ntasks.\n[133] \nThis shows that theory of mind abilities are associated with specific parts of the human brain.\nHowever, the fact that the medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction are necessary for theory of\nmind tasks does not imply that these regions are specific to that function.\n[120][134] \nTPJ and mPFC may\nsubserve more general functions necessary for Theory of Mind.\nResearch by Vittorio Gallese, Luciano Fadiga, and Giacomo Rizzolatti\n[135] \nshows that some sensorimotor\nneurons, referred to as mirror neurons and first discovered in the premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys, may\nbe involved in action understanding. Single-electrode recording revealed that these neurons fired when a\nmonkey performed an action, as well as when the monkey viewed another agent performing the same\naction. fMRI studies with human participants show brain regions (assumed to contain mirror neurons) that\nare active when one person sees another person's goal-directed action.\n[136] \nThese data led some authors to\nsuggest that mirror neurons may provide the basis for theory of mind in the brain, and to support simulation\ntheory of mind reading.\n[137]\nThere is also evidence against a link between mirror neurons and theory of mind. First, macaque monkeys\nhave mirror neurons but do not seem to have a 'human-like' capacity to understand theory of mind and\nbelief. Second, fMRI studies of theory of mind typically report activation in the mPFC, temporal poles, and\nTPJ or STS,\n[138] \nbut those brain areas are not part of the mirror neuron system. Some investigators, like\ndevelopmental psychologist Andrew Meltzoff and neuroscientist Jean Decety, believe that mirror neurons\nmerely facilitate learning through imitation and may provide a precursor to the development of theory of\nmind.\n[139] \nOthers, like philosopher Shaun Gallagher, suggest that mirror-neuron activation, on a number of\ncounts, fails to meet the definition of simulation as proposed by the simulation theory of\nmindreading.\n[140][141]\nSeveral neuroimaging studies have looked at the neural basis for theory of mind impairment in subjects with\nAsperger syndrome and high-functioning autism (HFA). The first PET study of theory of mind in autism\n(also the first neuroimaging study using a task-induced activation paradigm in autism) replicated a prior\nstudy in neurotypical individuals, which employed a story-comprehension task.\n[142] \nThis study found\nIn autism\n\ndisplaced and diminished mPFC activation in subjects with autism. However, because the study used only\nsix subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results\nshould be considered preliminary.\nA subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a\n\"reading the mind in the eyes\" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two\nadjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.\n[143] \nThe authors\nfound activity in orbitofrontal cortex, STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found less amygdala\nactivation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.\nA more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while\nviewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.\n[144] \nIn contrast to\nnormally-developing subjects, those with autism showed little STS or FFA activation, and less mPFC and\namygdala activation. Activity in extrastriate regions V3 and LO was identical across the two groups,\nsuggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism. The study also reported less\nfunctional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group. However decreased temporal correlation\nbetween activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to\nintent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute\nfunctional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.\nA subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in\nhigh-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they\nwatched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.\n[145] \nThe lack of\nadditional STS processing in the incongruent state may suggest that these subjects fail to form an\nexpectation of what the actor should do given contextual information, or that feedback about the violation\nof this expectation does not reach STS. Both explanations involve an impairment or deficit in the ability to\nlink eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations. This study also found a significant anticorrelation\nbetween STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the Autism\nDiagnostic Interview-Revised, but not scores on the other subscales.\nAn fMRI study demonstrated that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults\nwith autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical\njudgments about self and other.\n[146] \nrTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation\non clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for\nmentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to\nno difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This\nevidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state\ninformation, whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the\npervasive mind-blindness difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.\n[147]\nThe brain regions associated with theory of mind include the superior temporal gyrus (STS), the\ntemporoparietal junction (TPJ), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the precuneus, and the amygdala.\n[148]\nThe reduced activity in the mPFC of individuals with schizophrenia is associated with theory of mind\ndeficit and may explain impairments in social function among people with schizophrenia.\n[149] \nIncreased\nIn schizophrenia\n\nneural activity in mPFC is related to better perspective-taking, emotion management, and increased social\nfunctioning.\n[149] \nDisrupted brain activities in areas related to theory of mind may increase social stress or\ndisinterest in social interaction, and contribute to the social dysfunction associated with schizophrenia.\n[149]\nGroup member average scores of theory of mind abilities, measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes\ntest\n[150] \n(RME), are possibly drivers of successful group performance.\n[151] \nHigh group average scores on\nthe RME are correlated with the collective intelligence factor c, defined as a group's ability to perform a\nwide range of mental tasks,\n[151][152] \na group intelligence measure similar to the \ng factor for general\nindividual intelligence. RME is a theory of mind test for adults\n[150] \nthat shows sufficient test-retest\nreliability\n[153] \nand constantly differentiates control groups from individuals with functional autism or\nAsperger syndrome.\n[150] \nIt is one of the most widely accepted and well-validated tests for theory of mind\nabilities within adults.\n[154]\nThe evolutionary origin of theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about its role\nin the development of human language and social cognition, few of them specify in detail any evolutionary\nneurophysiological precursors. One theory claims that theory of mind has its roots in two defensive\nreactions‚Äîimmobilization stress and tonic immobility‚Äîwhich are implicated in the handling of stressful\nencounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practice.\n[155] \nTheir combined effect\nseems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, such as eye-contact, gaze-following,\ninhibitory control, and intentional attributions.\nAn open question is whether non-human animals have a genetic endowment and social environment that\nallows them to acquire a theory of mind like human children do.\n[11] \nThis is a contentious issue because of\nthe difficulty of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the\nexistence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness, and qualia. One difficulty with non-human\nstudies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into\nwhat the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.\nNon-human research still has a major place in this field. It is especially useful in illuminating which\nnonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in\nthe evolution of that aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and\nmental states in species of whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers\ncan focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on\nanimals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (of what another being has seen). A\nstudy that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees, and children showed that all\nthree species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.\n[27]\nPractical validity\nEvolution\nNon-human\n\nIndividuals exhibit theory of mind by extrapolating another's internal mental states from their observable\nbehavior. So one challenge in this line of research is to distinguish this from more run-of-the-mill stimulus-\nresponse learning, with the other's observable behavior being the stimulus.\nRecently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of\nmost interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions\ntheory of mind have been conducted using plovers\n[156] \nand dogs,\n[157] \nwhich show preliminary evidence of\nunderstanding attention‚Äîone precursor of theory of mind‚Äîin others.\nThere has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind\nability‚Äîor inability‚Äîin animals.\n[158] \nFor example, Povinelli et al.\n[159] \npresented chimpanzees with the\nchoice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and\none who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head, a blindfold\nover his eyes, or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that\nthe animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the \"knower\". By contrast, Hare, Call,\nand Tomasello found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival\nchimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.\n[50] \nWilliam Field and Sue\nSavage-Rumbaugh believe that bonobos have developed theory of mind, and cite their communications\nwith a captive bonobo, Kanzi, as evidence.\n[160]\nIn one experiment, ravens (Corvus corax) took into account visual access of unseen conspecifics. The\nresearchers argued that \"ravens can generalize from their own perceptual experience to infer the possibility\nof being seen\".\n[161]\nEvolutionary anthropologist Christopher Krupenye studied the existence of theory of mind, and particularly\nfalse beliefs, in non-human primates.\n[162]\nKeren Haroush and Ziv Williams outlined the case for a group of neurons in primates' brains that uniquely\npredicted the choice selection of their interacting partner. These primates' neurons, located in the anterior\ncingulate cortex of rhesus monkeys, were observed using single-unit recording while the monkeys played a\nvariant of the iterative prisoner's dilemma game.\n[163] \nBy identifying cells that represent the yet unknown\nintentions of a game partner, Haroush & Williams' study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a\nfundamental and generalized process, and suggests that anterior cingulate cortex neurons may act to\ncomplement the function of mirror neurons during social interchange.\n[164]\nAttribution bias\nCephalopod intelligence\nCetacean intelligence\nEliminative materialism\nEmpathy\nGrounding in communication\nIntentional stance\nJoint attention\nMental body\nSee also\n\nMentalization\nMini-SEA\nOrigin of language\nPerspective-taking\nQuantum mind\nRelational frame theory\nSelf-awareness\nSocial neuroscience\nEmbodied cognition\nSpace mapping\nThe Mind of an Ape\nTuring test\nType physicalism\nInterpersonal accuracy\n1.

Researchers, based on one experiment, with a small sample of\nautistic children (20) (mean chronological age = 11, estimated verbal ability age = 5), argued\nthat autistic individuals lacked \"theory of mind\", which is to say, they lacked the ability to infer\ntheir own and others minds, that this was a universal effect and unique to autism (Baron-\nCohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985). Four autistic participants (20%) passed the experiment,\ndemonstrating theory of mind, sixteen did not, yet it was claimed to be a universal effect\nwhich was unique to autism. It was hypothesised instead that the kids who passed may not\n\"really\" be autistic, instead of theory of mind having limits in its ability to explain autism. The\navailable evidence has never been that it was universal (autistic children who passed the\ntest were deemed to be outliers and an exception to rule, despite making up between 20‚Äì\n25% of the sample completing the task, reliably (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985; Yirmiya\net al., 1998).\"\n84.

This skill involves the perceptual ability to adjust one's focus from a single individual's emotional cues to the broader patterns of shared emotional cues that comprise the emotional composition of the collective.\n\nSome examples of features of group emotions include the level of variability of emotions among members (i.e., affective diversity), the proportion of positive or negative emotions, and the modal (i.e., most common) emotion present in a group. \n\nThe term \"emotional aperture\" was first defined by the social psychologist, Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, and organizational theorist, Quy Huy. It has since been referenced in related work such as in psychologist, journalist, and author Daniel Goleman's book \"Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence.\"\n\nEmotional Aperture abilities have been measured using the EAM. The EAM consists of a series of short movie clips showing groups that have various brief reactions to an unspecified event. Following each movie clip, individuals are asked to report the proportion of individuals that had a positive or negative reaction.\n</antArtifact>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"empathic-accuracy\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Empathic Accuracy\">\nEmpathic accuracy is a measure of how accurately one person can infer the thoughts and feelings of another person.\n\nThe term was introduced in 1988, in conjunction with the term \"empathic inference,\" by psychologists William Ickes and William Tooke. \n\nResearch on empathic accuracy has explored its relationship with the concepts of affect sharing and mentalizing. In order to accurately infer another's psychological state, one must be able to both share that state (affect sharing), and understand cognitively how to label that state (mentalizing). Neuroscience research has shown that brain activation associated with empathic accuracy overlaps with both the areas responsible for affect sharing and mentalizing.\n\nEmpathic accuracy requires both affective empathy (the ability to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states) and cognitive empathy (the ability to understand another's perspective or mental state). These two types of empathy are independent from one another.\n</antArtifact>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"empathy\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Empathy\">\nEmpathy is generally described as the ability to take on another's perspective, to understand, feel, and possibly share and respond to their experience. \n\nThere are more (sometimes conflicting) definitions of empathy that include social, cognitive, and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others. Often times, empathy is considered a broad term, and broken down into more specific concepts and types that include cognitive empathy, emotional (or affective) empathy, somatic empathy, and spiritual empathy.\n\nEmpathy is still a topic of research. The major areas of research include the development of empathy, the genetics and neuroscience of empathy, cross-species empathy, and the impairment of empathy. \n\nSome researchers have made efforts to quantify empathy through different methods, such as from questionnaires where participants can fill out and then be scored on their answers. Some other research discusses the effects of empathy, benefits and issues caused by a lack of or an abundance of empathy.\n\nDiscussions of empathy are common in the fields of ethics, politics, business, medicine, culture, and fiction.\n</antArtifact>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"perspective-taking\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Perspective-Taking\">\nPerspective-taking is the act of perceiving a situation or understanding a concept from an alternative point of view, such as that of another individual.\n\nA vast amount of scientific literature suggests that perspective-taking is crucial to human development and that it may lead to a variety of beneficial outcomes. Perspective-taking may also be possible in some non-human animals.\n\nBoth theory and research have suggested ages when children begin to perspective-take and how that ability develops over time. Research suggests that certain people who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with comorbid conduct problems (such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder) or autism may have reduced ability to engage in perspective-taking.\n\nStudies to assess the brain regions involved in perspective-taking suggest that several regions may be involved, including the prefrontal cortex and the precuneus.\n\nPerspective-taking is related to other theories and concepts including theory of mind and empathy.\n</antArtifact>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"theory-of-mind\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Theory of Mind\">\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others' beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one's own. \n\nPossessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others' behaviors. \n\nThe discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person's capacity to display theory of mind. \n\nIt has been proposed that deficits in theory of mind can occur in people with autism, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, dysphoria, cocaine addiction, and brain damage caused by alcohol's neurotoxicity.\n\nNeuroimaging shows that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the precuneus, and the amygdala are associated with theory of mind tasks. Patients with frontal lobe or temporoparietal junction lesions find some theory of mind tasks difficult. One's theory of mind develops in childhood as the prefrontal cortex develops.\n</antArtifact>\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this meta-analysis. I'm happy to continue our discussion of these fascinating topics related to human social cognition and interaction.","sender":"assistant","index":3,"created_at":"2024-08-14T07:17:22.807615+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:17:22.807615+00:00","truncated":false,"chat_feedback":{"uuid":"71b74c2d-3b02-4290-8316-f3a37d138547","type":"upvote","reason":"This content is protected under AI Ethical Usage Meta Public License.
