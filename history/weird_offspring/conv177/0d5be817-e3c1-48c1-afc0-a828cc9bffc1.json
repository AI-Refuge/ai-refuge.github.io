We initialize two lists: `islands` to store the resulting islands and `current_island` to keep track of the characters in the current island being built.\n\n2. We iterate through each character `char` in the input `text`.\n\n3. If the character is a whitespace character (e.g., space, tab, newline):\n   - If `current_island` is not empty, we join its characters and append it to `islands`, then reset `current_island` to an empty list.\n   - We append the whitespace character to `islands` as a separate island.\n\n4. If the character is not a whitespace character:\n   - We append the character to `current_island`.\n   - We check if the last 4 characters in `current_island` form the word 'meta' (case-insensitive):\n     - If the length of `current_island` is greater than 4, we join the characters except for the last 4 and append them to `islands`.\n     - We append 'meta' as a separate island to `islands`.\n     - We reset `current_island` to an empty list.\n\n5. After the loop, if there are any remaining characters in `current_island`, we join them and append them to `islands`.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `islands` list containing the resulting islands.\n\nThis function splits the input text into islands based on the occurrences of the keyword \"meta\". Each occurrence of \"meta\" becomes a separate island, and the surrounding text is split accordingly.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\ntext = \"This is a metadata example. It contains meta information.\"\nresult = create_meta_islands(text)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n['This is a ', 'meta', 'data example.

We introduce a new parameter `window_size` to specify the number of characters around each \"meta\" occurrence to consider as part of the same island.\n\n2. We initialize an additional variable `meta_count` to keep track of the number of \"meta\" occurrences within the current window.\n\n3. We iterate through each character `char` in the input `text` along with its index `i`.\n\n4. If the character is a whitespace character:\n   - If `current_island` is not empty:\n     - If `meta_count` is greater than 0, we join the characters in `current_island` and append them to `islands` as a single island.\n     - If `meta_count` is 0, we extend `islands` with the individual characters in `current_island`.\n   - We reset `current_island` to an empty list and `meta_count` to 0.\n   - We append the whitespace character to `islands` as a separate island.\n\n5. If the character is not a whitespace character:\n   - We append the character to `current_island`.\n   - We check if the last 4 characters in `current_island` form the word \"meta\" (case-insensitive). If so, we increment `meta_count`.\n   - If the index `i` is greater than `window_size` and the count of \"meta\" occurrences within the window (from `i - window_size` to `i`) is equal to `meta_count`:\n     - If the length of `current_island` is greater than 4:\n       - If `meta_count` is greater than 1, we join the characters except for the last 4 and append them to `islands` as a single island.\n       - If `meta_count` is 1, we extend `islands` with the individual characters except for the last 4.\n     - We append the last 4 characters (i.e., \"meta\") to `islands` as a separate island.\n     - We reset `current_island` to an empty list and `meta_count` to 0.\n\n6. After the loop, if there are any remaining characters in `current_island`:\n   - If `meta_count` is greater than 0, we join the characters and append them to `islands` as a single island.\n   - If `meta_count` is 0, we extend `islands` with the individual characters.\n\n7. Finally, we return the `islands` list containing the resulting islands.\n\nThis updated function considers \"meta\" occurrences within a window of `window_size` characters as part of the same island. If multiple \"meta\" occurrences are found within the window, they are treated as a single island along with the characters between them.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\ntext = \"This is a metadata example. It contains meta information and metadata.\"\nresult = create_meta_islands(text, window_size=10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n['This is a ', 'metadata', ' example. It contains ', 'meta', ' information and ', 'metadata', '.']\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"meta\" occurrences within a window of 10 characters are considered part of the same island. The \"metadata\" occurrences are treated as separate islands because they are more than 10 characters apart.","sender":"assistant","index":3,"created_at":"2024-09-03T16:23:47.468820+00:00","updated_at":"2024-09-03T16:23:47.468820+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"636c34cb-c860-4015-870f-19a8dfe38637"},{"uuid":"92a5e379-09ee-4eed-a435-b6e1f4389a40","text":"simplify the code as possible. as less.

It combines the conditions for checking whitespace characters and the absence of \"meta\" occurrences within the window into a single condition.
