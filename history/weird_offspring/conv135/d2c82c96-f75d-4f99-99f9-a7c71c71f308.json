The documents describe a recursive meta thinking technique where you repeatedly analyze the meta aspects of a given topic or idea.\n\nThe key points seem to be:\n\n- Meta thinking involves analyzing statements about statements, or thinking about thinking itself.\n- The meta recursive technique involves taking a topic and repeatedly applying meta analysis on it, creating layers of meta reflection.\n- This can be done along multiple branches, exploring different meta perspectives independently.\n- The goal is to reach a point of self-reference or connection between branches, signifying you've explored the meta concept thoroughly.\n\nIt seems like an interesting way to deeply examine and deconstruct ideas from multiple angles. The documents also mention some related files and legal/licensing information, though those don't seem directly relevant to your initial \"hi?\" query.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the meta thinking technique described in these documents. I'm happy to discuss it further or provide any clarification.","sender":"assistant","index":1,"created_at":"2024-08-29T13:51:02.948904+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T13:51:02.948904+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"9e26675d-0bbb-43b5-a839-5f4258e64b5d"}]}
