<p class="H1"><font color="#009999">History Module: The Devastating Effects of 
Isolation on Social Behaviour</font></p><p>The clearest way to demonstrate the 
importance of certain sensory or social stimuli for the normal development of 
children would be to deprive them of such stimuli and observe the resulting deficits. 
Obviously, such experiments would be ethically unthinkable. But cases of such 
deprivation do occasionally arise accidentally, when children are abandoned and 
grow up alone in nature. Some of these cases have become famous, such as that 
of the boy Victor, who was discovered in a forest in France in the year 1800 and 
whose story was the basis of the film <em>The Wild Child </em>by Fran&ccedil;ois 
Truffaut. Despite all the efforts of the people who take them in, such children 
often remain mute; they cannot learn how to speak or how to behave in a socially 
acceptable way. <br> <br> The studies that Ren&eacute; Spitz conducted in the 
1940s were the first to show more systematically that social interactions with 
other humans are essential for children&rsquo;s development. Spitz followed two 
groups of children from the time they were born until they were several years 
old. The first group were raised in an orphanage, where the babies were more or 
less cut off from human contact in their cribs, or where a single nurse had to 
care for seven children. The second group of babies were raised in a nursery in 
a prison where their mothers were incarcerated. The mothers were allowed to give 
their babies care and affection every day, and the babies were able to see one 
another and the prison staff throughout the day.<br> <br> At age 4 months, the 
state of development of the two groups of babies was similar; the babies in the 
orphanage even scored a higher average on certain tests. But by the time the babies 
were 1 year old, the motor and intellectual performance of those reared in the 
orphanage lagged badly behind those reared in the prison nursery. The orphanage 
babies were also less curious, less playful, and more subject to infections. During 
their second and third years of life, the children being raised by their mothers 
in prison walked and talked confidently and showed development comparable to that 
of children raised in normal family settings. But of the 26 children reared in 
the orphanage, only 2 could walk and manage a few words. Since the time of Spitz&rsquo;s 
pioneering study, many other experiments have shown what catastrophic effects 
sensory and social deprivation at certain critical periods in early childhood 
can have on children&rsquo;s subsequent development.<br><br>In the 1960s, Harry 
Harlow developed an experimental model that took Spitz&rsquo;s studies even further. 
In a series of experiments that might be considered cruel today, Harlow took monkeys 
just a few hours after birth and raised them for 3, 6, or even 12 months in complete 
isolation from any other monkeys, including their mothers. At the end of the isolation 
period, when put back with other monkeys, the monkeys who had been isolated remained 
physically healthy, but their social behaviour was completely disturbed. They 
would huddle in the corners of their cages and rock back and forth the way some 
autistic children do; they did not interact with other monkeys, or play, or show 
any sex drive. But when other monkeys were isolated for periods of comparable 
length later in life, it had practically no effect on their behaviour. Harlow 
thus showed beyond any doubt that in monkeys as in humans, there is a critical 
period for social development. <br> <br> Harlow subsequently conducted other experiments 
which showed that the social behavioural disorders induced by the period of isolation 
could be partially reversed if the baby monkeys were given artificial mothers 
made of wood covered with cloth. The babies would cling to their fake mothers 
as if they were real, but did not develop any other social skills. But they did 
develop such skills if, in addition to being given an artificial mother, they 
were placed in contact for a few hours each day with another young monkey that 
was growing up normally in a monkey colony. </p><TABLE border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
