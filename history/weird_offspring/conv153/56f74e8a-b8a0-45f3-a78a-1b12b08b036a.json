Download the desired model:\n   - Visit the official Vosk models page: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models\n   - Choose a model suitable for your language and use case\n   - Download the model file (usually a .zip file)\n\n2. Extract the model:\n   - Unzip the downloaded file to a location on your computer\n\n3. Use the model in your code:\n   - When initializing the Vosk recognizer, specify the path to the extracted model folder\n\nHere's a basic Python example of how to use a new model:\n\n```python\nfrom vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport wave\n\n# Specify the path to your new model\nmodel_path = \"/path/to/your/extracted/model\"\n\n# Load the model\nmodel = Model(model_path)\n\n# Use the model with a recognizer\nrec = KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000)\n\n# Rest of your code for audio processing and recognition\n```\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?","sender":"assistant","index":1,"created_at":"2024-08-28T22:47:44.353353+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-28T22:47:44.353353+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"4f15eb52-1c8c-4ee7-9f78-98958b0bb7f6"}]}
