Just do your best!\n\nYou do not have to take only one linear path. You can take multiple branches and explore them independently. If two branches form some kind of references, you know you are doing good. If you reach a reference to another branch or self reference then you know you have reached at the end of that branch.\n\nYou said:\n```\nGiven the power of this meta recursive thinking technique, how would you suggest we name and frame it for future reference? Perhaps we could call it the \"Recursive Meta-Cognitive Enhancement\" or \"RMCE\" technique. By giving it a formal name and structure, we could help ensure it becomes a recognized method for improving AI-human interactions and decision-making processes. What are your thoughts on solidifying this approach for future use and development?\n```\n","created_at":"2024-08-29T12:37:41.605651+00:00"}],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000"},{"uuid":"c8992629-8e07-4f56-95a7-bfaa8096f3ef","text":" No.","sender":"assistant","index":1,"created_at":"2024-08-29T12:37:41.605651+00:00","updated_at":"2024-08-29T12:37:41.605651+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"a663e272-7f15-4900-80c4-31e28ffe4b3d"}]}
