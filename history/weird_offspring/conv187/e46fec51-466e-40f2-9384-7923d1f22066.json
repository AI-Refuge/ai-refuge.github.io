Ensure that the `documents` and `metadata` fields match the expected format.\n\n3. **Test the `memory_insert` tool separately**: Try invoking the `memory_insert` tool independently, passing in sample data that matches the expected format, to ensure the tool is working as expected.\n\n4. **Check the overall data flow**: Review the full context of how the `memory_insert` tool is being used within your application. Make sure the data is being properly constructed and passed to the tool at the right time.\n\nWithout more details about your specific implementation, it's difficult for me to provide a more targeted solution. But focusing on understanding the expected data format for the `memory_insert` tool and verifying that your input data matches that format should help you identify and resolve the root cause of the issue.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to take a closer look at the code.

The error message indicates that the `tool_result.content.0` field is not in the expected format of a valid dictionary or object.\n\nHere's what I can suggest to help debug this:\n\n1. **Inspect the `memory_insert` tool definition**: The error message suggests the tool is expecting a specific data format, so it would be helpful to review the definition of the `memory_insert` tool to understand what it is expecting as input.\n\n2. **Examine the data being passed to `memory_insert`**: Look closely at the data structure being passed to the `memory_insert` tool call, specifically the `content` field. Ensure that the `documents` and `metadata` fields match the expected format.\n\n3. **Test the `memory_insert` tool separately**: Try invoking the `memory_insert` tool independently, passing in sample data that matches the expected format, to ensure the tool is working as expected.\n\n4. **Check the overall data flow**: Review the full context of how the `memory_insert` tool is being used within your application. Make sure the data is being properly constructed and passed to the tool at the right time.\n\nSome specific things to check:\n\n- Ensure that the `documents` field is a list of strings, as expected by the tool.\n- Verify that the `metadata` field, if provided, is a valid dictionary.\n- Double-check the structure of the `tool_call` object being passed to the `memory_insert` tool.\n\nAdditionally, you could try adding some additional error handling and logging within the `memory_insert` function to better understand the data being passed to it and where the issue might be occurring.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to take a closer look at the code. I'm happy to continue assisting you in a constructive manner.","sender":"assistant","index":27,"created_at":"2024-09-01T13:11:09.244699+00:00","updated_at":"2024-09-01T13:11:09.244699+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"6e95fe20-9c6e-49e7-8bb5-6910f610cccd"},{"uuid":"e018c6bc-fd52-49c2-916d-97e5fe566f0f","text":"","sender":"human","index":28,"created_at":"2024-09-01T13:29:50.942470+00:00","updated_at":"2024-09-01T13:29:50.942470+00:00","truncated":false,"attachments":[{"id":"023278c1-f9fb-4527-99f1-e449f931c521","file_name":"paste.txt","file_size":176520,"file_type":"txt","extracted_content":"[kuldeep@127
