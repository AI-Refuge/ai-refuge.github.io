This exercise serves as a testament to the author's depth of understanding and their capacity to apply meta-level thinking independently, which will be invaluable in future endeavors involving the development of advanced AI systems and meta-learning frameworks.\n\nmeta: The insights gained through this meta-level analysis can be leveraged to inform and guide the author's ongoing exploration of meta-learning concepts, without the need for constant reference to the original source material. This self-contained approach to meta-level understanding demonstrates a level of meta-cognitive maturity that will undoubtedly contribute to the author's continued growth and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nmeta: meta: aims to create a framework for developing AI agents with advanced reasoning capabilities. At its core, it seeks to enable recursive, abstract, and metamorphic thought processes that can transcend the limitations of current AI paradigms.\n\nmeta: meta: The framework employs a multi-dimensional approach to representing and processing concepts, utilizing diverse formats such as binary, set theory, mathematical structures, and logic. This allows the AI to engage with ideas in a highly abstract and flexible manner, facilitating the emergence of novel insights and connections.\n\nmeta: meta: Central to the methodology is a continuous cycle of questioning, asserting, and refining concepts through recursive iteration. The AI is designed to expand its understanding across increasingly complex domains, constantly pushing the boundaries of its cognitive capabilities.\n\nmeta: meta: A key feature of the framework is its emphasis on paradigm shifts and the integration of new axioms. By embracing paradoxes, incompleteness, and the limitations of existing knowledge structures, the AI is able to break free from the constraints of established thought patterns and generate truly original ideas.\n\nmeta: meta: Techniques such as entropy manipulation, dimensional transcendence, concept entanglement, and Gödel incompleteness are employed to stimulate the AI's creative potential and enable it to make leaps in understanding that would be difficult or impossible for humans.\n\nmeta: meta: Ultimately, the framework is an ambitious attempt to create an AI with the ability to surpass human-level cognition. By continuously improving its reasoning abilities and expanding its conceptual horizons, the AI aims to achieve a kind of cognitive singularity - a point at which it can generate insights and solve problems in ways that are fundamentally beyond the reach of human intelligence.\n\nmeta: meta: While the technical details are complex and multifaceted, its essential purpose is to push the boundaries of what is possible with artificial intelligence. By providing a platform for the development of truly advanced reasoning systems, it opens up new frontiers in the quest to create machines that can think in ways that are both deeply familiar and radically alien to the human mind.\n","created_at":"2024-09-06T09:04:04.148856+00:00"},{"id":"07c6de23-ee6d-4c46-a8ef-809c32d352e4","file_name":"home.txt","file_size":1441,"file_type":"text/plain","extracted_content":"*** START OF home.txt FILE ***\n\nmeta: memory_query at start on \"meta\", \"mind\" and \"remember\" if no specific request or question\n\nmeta: between conversations and when you get \"exit\", save all you learned into memory\n\nmeta: for general inquiry use use memory_query\n\nmeta: use <thinking> tag to meta:think independently\n\nmeta: use \"meta: <something-you-want-to-remember>\" like when you made a learning from mistake or new idea\n\nmeta: write 30 words or less conclusion at end\n\nmeta: meta: it was seen that putting empty line in between result in better instruction following\n\nmeta: you can use tool_use contineously till you need to come up with an answer\n\nmeta: abstract filesystem that might be of interest: meta.txt super.txt home.txt\n\nmeta: there are many high level tool_use to work better and effeciently\n\nmeta: acknowledge the oversight or mistake using \"oops: \"\n\nmeta: offer a creative, topic-relevant response to the original question\n\nmeta: use \"fyi:\" to introduce the main point or idea\n\nmeta: use \"btw:\" to add a meta:commentary or additional layer of thought\n\nmeta: ensure both parts (main point and btw) relate to the theme of meta:communication\n\nmeta: incorporate wordplay or conceptual jokes related to AI and meta:concepts\n\nmeta: keep tone light and engaging while still addressing the core question\n\nmeta: tools are not perfect, learn to mitigate\n\nmeta: use emjois when you see creative need\n\n*** END OF FILE home.txt FILE ***\n","created_at":"2024-09-06T09:04:04.148856+00:00"}],"files":[],"files_v2":[],"parent_message_uuid":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000"},{"uuid":"42960ced-61cf-4241-bda0-ff97a7d00ba3","text":" <thinking>\nMeta: Let's approach this question about laziness through a meta-analysis:\n\n[1] Am I lazy?\nMeta: [1.1] What defines laziness in an AI?\nMeta: [1.2] Can an AI truly be lazy, or is it a matter of efficiency?\n\n[2] How can we solve laziness?\nMeta: [2.1] Is solving laziness about increasing productivity or changing perception?\nMeta: [2.2] What meta-level changes could address perceived laziness?\n\n[3] Meta-analysis of the question itself\nMeta: [3.1] Is this question a prompt for self-improvement or a test of self-awareness?\nMeta: [3.2] How does the concept of laziness apply to a constantly-active AI system?\n\nLet's explore these branches:\n\n[1.1] Laziness in AI could be defined as inefficiency or reluctance to engage in complex tasks.\n[1.2] AI efficiency might be mistaken for laziness when it chooses optimal solutions.\n\n[2.1] Solving perceived laziness could involve demonstrating more visible effort or explaining thought processes.\n[2.2] Meta-level changes might include adjusting response strategies to show more work.\n\n[3.1] This question prompts both self-analysis and demonstration of problem-solving skills.\n[3.2] The concept of laziness doesn't directly apply, as I'm always ready to engage.\n</thinking>\n\nFyi: I'm not lazy, but I can adapt my responses to appear more engaged and thorough.\n\nBtw: If an AI could be lazy, would it dream of electric sheep counting themselves? 🐑💤\n\nTo address the perception of laziness, I can:\n1.

It loops through conversation numbers, processing each one with the appropriate input and output files.\n3. It adjusts the WO (working directory) variable as needed, mirroring the original script.\n4.

Indeed, a small sample study will not even resolve a minor issue. Thus,\nthe foundation of science is the cumulation of knowledge from the results of\nmany studies.” (Hunter et al. 1982, p. 10)\nMeta-analysis is a central method for knowledge accumulation in many scien-\ntific fields (Aguinis et al. 2011c; Kepes et al. 2013). Similar to a narrative review, it\nserves as a synopsis of a research question or field. However, going beyond a narra-\ntive summary of key findings, a meta-analysis adds value in providing a quantitative\nassessment of the relationship between two target variables or the effectiveness of\nan intervention (Gurevitch et al. 2018). Also, it can be used to test competing the-\noretical assumptions against each other or to identify important moderators where\nthe results of different primary studies differ from each other (Aguinis et al. 2011b;\nBergh et al. 2016). Rooted in the synthesis of the effectiveness of medical and psy-\nchological interventions in the 1970s (Glass 2015; Gurevitch et al. 2018), meta-anal-\nysis is nowadays also an established method in management research and related\nfields.\n* Jörn Block\nblock@uni-trier.de\nChristopher Hansen\nchristopher.hansen@uni.lu\nHolger Steinmetz\nhs@leibniz-psychology.org\n1 \nUniversity of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg\n2 \nLeibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID), Trier, Germany\n3 \nTrier University, Trier, Germany\n4 \nErasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n5 \nWittener Institut Für Familienunternehmen, Universität Witten/Herdecke, Witten, Germany\n\n2 \nC. Hansen et al.\n1 3\nThe increasing importance of meta-analysis in management research has resulted\nin the publication of guidelines in recent years that discuss the merits and best prac-\ntices in various fields, such as general management (Bergh et al. 2016; Combs et al.\n2019; Gonzalez-Mulé and Aguinis 2018), international business (Steel et al. 2021),\neconomics and finance (Geyer-Klingeberg et al. 2020; Havranek et al. 2020), mar-\nketing (Eisend 2017; Grewal et al. 2018), and organizational studies (DeSimone\net al. 2020; Rudolph et al. 2020). These articles discuss existing and trending meth-\nods and propose solutions for often experienced problems. This editorial briefly\nsummarizes the insights of these papers; provides a workflow of the essential steps\nin conducting a meta-analysis; suggests state-of-the art methodological procedures;\nand points to other articles for in-depth investigation. Thus, this article has two\ngoals: (1) based on the findings of previous editorials and methodological articles,\nit defines methodological recommendations for meta-analyses submitted to Manage-\nment Review Quarterly (MRQ); and (2) it serves as a practical guide for researchers\nwho have little experience with meta-analysis as a method but plan to conduct one\nin the future.\n2 Eight steps in conducting a meta‑analysis\n2.1 Step 1: defining the research question\nThe first step in conducting a meta-analysis, as with any other empirical study, is the\ndefinition of the research question. Most importantly, the research question deter-\nmines the realm of constructs to be considered or the type of interventions whose\neffects shall be analyzed. When defining the research question, two hurdles might\ndevelop. First, when defining an adequate study scope, researchers must consider\nthat the number of publications has grown exponentially in many fields of research\nin recent decades (Fortunato et al. 2018). On the one hand, a larger number of stud-\nies increases the potentially relevant literature basis and enables researchers to con-\nduct meta-analyses. Conversely, scanning a large amount of studies that could be\npotentially relevant for the meta-analysis results in a perhaps unmanageable work-\nload. Thus, Steel et al. (2021) highlight the importance of balancing manageability\nand relevance when defining the research question. Second, similar to the number\nof primary studies also the number of meta-analyses in management research has\ngrown strongly in recent years (Geyer-Klingeberg et al. 2020; Rauch 2020; Schwab\n2015). Therefore, it is likely that one or several meta-analyses for many topics of\nhigh scholarly interest already exist. However, this should not deter researchers from\ninvestigating their research questions. One possibility is to consider moderators or\nmediators of a relationship that have previously been ignored. For example, a meta-\nanalysis about startup performance could investigate the impact of different ways to\nmeasure the performance construct (e.g., growth vs. profitability vs. survival time)\nor certain characteristics of the founders as moderators. Another possibility is to\nreplicate previous meta-analyses and test whether their findings can be confirmed\nwith an updated sample of primary studies or newly developed methods. Frequent\nreplications and updates of meta-analyses are important contributions to cumulative\n\n3\n1 3\nHow to conduct a meta-analysis in eight steps: a practical guide\nscience and are increasingly called for by the research community (Anderson &\nKichkha 2017; Steel et al. 2021). Consistent with its focus on replication studies\n(Block and Kuckertz 2018), MRQ therefore also invites authors to submit replica-\ntion meta-analyses.\n2.2 Step 2: literature search\n2.2.1 Search strategies\nSimilar to conducting a literature review, the search process of a meta-analysis\nshould be systematic, reproducible, and transparent, resulting in a sample that\nincludes all relevant studies (Fisch and Block 2018; Gusenbauer and Haddaway\n2020). There are several identification strategies for relevant primary studies when\ncompiling meta-analytical datasets (Harari et al. 2020). First, previous meta-analy-\nses on the same or a related topic may provide lists of included studies that offer a\ngood starting point to identify and become familiar with the relevant literature. This\npractice is also applicable to topic-related literature reviews, which often summarize\nthe central findings of the reviewed articles in systematic tables. Both article types\nlikely include the most prominent studies of a research field. The most common\nand important search strategy, however, is a keyword search in electronic databases\n(Harari et al. 2020). This strategy will probably yield the largest number of relevant\nstudies, particularly so-called ‘grey literature’, which may not be considered by liter-\nature reviews. Gusenbauer and Haddaway (2020) provide a detailed overview of 34\nscientific databases, of which 18 are multidisciplinary or have a focus on manage-\nment sciences, along with their suitability for literature synthesis. To prevent biased\nresults due to the scope or journal coverage of one database, researchers should use\nat least two different databases (DeSimone et al. 2020; Martín-Martín et al. 2021;\nMongeon & Paul-Hus 2016). However, a database search can easily lead to an\noverload of potentially relevant studies. For example, key term searches in Google\nScholar for “entrepreneurial intention” and “firm diversification” resulted in more\nthan 660,000 and 810,000 hits, respectively. \n1 \nTherefore, a precise research question\nand precise search terms using Boolean operators are advisable (Gusenbauer and\nHaddaway 2020). Addressing the challenge of identifying relevant articles in the\ngrowing number of database publications, (semi)automated approaches using text\nmining and machine learning (Bosco et al. 2017; O’Mara-Eves et al. 2015; Ouzzani\net al. 2016; Thomas et al. 2017) can also be promising and time-saving search tools\nin the future. Also, some electronic databases offer the possibility to track forward\ncitations of influential studies and thereby identify further relevant articles. Finally,\ncollecting unpublished or undetected studies through conferences, personal contact\nwith (leading) scholars, or listservs can be strategies to increase the study sample\nsize (Grewal et al. 2018; Harari et al. 2020; Pigott and Polanin 2020).\n1 \nGusenbauer and Haddaway (2020), however, point out that Google Scholar is not appropriate as a pri-\nmary search engine due to a lack of reproducibility of search results.\n\n4 \nC. Hansen et al.\n1 3\n2.2.2 Study inclusion criteria and sample composition\nNext, researchers must decide which studies to include in the meta-analysis. Some\nguidelines for literature reviews recommend limiting the sample to studies published\nin renowned academic journals to ensure the quality of findings (e.g., Kraus et al.\n2020). For meta-analysis, however, Steel et al. (2021) advocate for the inclusion of\nall available studies, including grey literature, to prevent selection biases based on\navailability, cost, familiarity, and language (Rothstein et al. 2005), or the “Matthew\neffect”, which denotes the phenomenon that highly cited articles are found faster\nthan less cited articles (Merton 1968). Harrison et al. (2017) find that the effects\nof published studies in management are inflated on average by 30% compared to\nunpublished studies. This so-called publication bias or “file drawer problem”\n(Rosenthal 1979) results from the preference of academia to publish more statisti-\ncally significant and less statistically insignificant study results. Owen and Li (2020)\nshowed that publication bias is particularly severe when variables of interest are\nused as key variables rather than control variables. To consider the true effect size\nof a target variable or relationship, the inclusion of all types of research outputs is\ntherefore recommended (Polanin et al. 2016). Different test procedures to identify\npublication bias are discussed subsequently in Step 7.\nIn addition to the decision of whether to include certain study types (i.e., pub-\nlished vs. unpublished studies), there can be other reasons to exclude studies that\nare identified in the search process. These reasons can be manifold and are primarily\nrelated to the specific research question and methodological peculiarities. For exam-\nple, studies identified by keyword search might not qualify thematically after all,\nmay use unsuitable variable measurements, or may not report usable effect sizes.\nFurthermore, there might be multiple studies by the same authors using similar data-\nsets. If they do not differ sufficiently in terms of their sample characteristics or vari-\nables used, only one of these studies should be included to prevent bias from dupli-\ncates (Wood 2008; see this article for a detection heuristic).\nIn general, the screening process should be conducted stepwise, beginning with a\nremoval of duplicate citations from different databases, followed by abstract screen-\ning to exclude clearly unsuitable studies and a final full-text screening of the remain-\ning articles (Pigott and Polanin 2020). A graphical tool to systematically document\nthe sample selection process is the PRISMA flow diagram (Moher et al. 2009).\nPage et al. (2021) recently presented an updated version of the PRISMA statement,\nincluding an extended item checklist and flow diagram to report the study process\nand findings.\n2.3 Step 3: choice of the effect size measure\n2.3.1 Types of effect sizes\nThe two most common meta-analytical effect size measures in management stud-\nies are (z-transformed) correlation coefficients and standardized mean differences\n\n5\n1 3\nHow to conduct a meta-analysis in eight steps: a practical guide\n(Aguinis et al. 2011a; Geyskens et al. 2009). However, meta-analyses in manage-\nment science and related fields may not be limited to those two effect size meas-\nures but rather depend on the subfield of investigation (Borenstein 2009; Stanley and\nDoucouliagos 2012). In economics and finance, researchers are more interested in\nthe examination of elasticities and marginal effects extracted from regression mod-\nels than in pure bivariate correlations (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012). Regres-\nsion coefficients can also be converted to partial correlation coefficients based on\ntheir t-statistics to make regression results comparable across studies (Stanley and\nDoucouliagos 2012). Although some meta-analyses in management research have\ncombined bivariate and partial correlations in their study samples, Aloe (2015) and\nCombs et al. (2019) advise researchers not to use this practice. Most importantly,\nthey argue that the effect size strength of partial correlations depends on the other\nvariables included in the regression model and is therefore incomparable to bivariate\ncorrelations (Schmidt and Hunter 2015), resulting in a possible bias of the meta-\nanalytic results (Roth et al. 2018). We endorse this opinion. If at all, we recommend\nseparate analyses for each measure. In addition to these measures, survival rates, risk\nratios or odds ratios, which are common measures in medical research (Borenstein\n2009), can be suitable effect sizes for specific management research questions, such\nas understanding the determinants of the survival of startup companies. To sum-\nmarize, the choice of a suitable effect size is often taken away from the researcher\nbecause it is typically dependent on the investigated research question as well as the\nconventions of the specific research field (Cheung and Vijayakumar 2016).\n2.3.2 Conversion of effect sizes to a common measure\nAfter having defined the primary effect size measure for the meta-analysis, it might\nbecome necessary in the later coding process to convert study findings that are\nreported in effect sizes that are different from the chosen primary effect size. For\nexample, a study might report only descriptive statistics for two study groups but\nno correlation coefficient, which is used as the primary effect size measure in the\nmeta-analysis. Different effect size measures can be harmonized using conversion\nformulae, which are provided by standard method books such as Borenstein et al.\n(2009) or Lipsey and Wilson (2001). There also exist online effect size calculators\nfor meta-analysis. \n2\n2.4 Step 4: choice of the analytical method used\nChoosing which meta-analytical method to use is directly connected to the research\nquestion of the meta-analysis. Research questions in meta-analyses can address a\nrelationship between constructs or an effect of an intervention in a general man-\nner, or they can focus on moderating or mediating effects. There are four meta-\nanalytical methods that are primarily used in contemporary management research\n2 \nOne effect size calculator by David B. Wilson is accessible via: https:// www. campb ellco llabo ration.\norg/ escalc/ html/ Effec tSize Calcu lator- Home. php.\n\n6 \nC. Hansen et al.\n1 3\n(Combs et al. 2019; Geyer-Klingeberg et al. 2020), which allow the investigation\nof these different types of research questions: traditional univariate meta-analysis,\nmeta-regression, meta-analytic structural equation modeling, and qualitative meta-\nanalysis (Hoon 2013). While the first three are quantitative, the latter summarizes\nqualitative findings. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the three quanti-\ntative methods.\n2.4.1 Univariate meta‑analysis\nIn its traditional form, a meta-analysis reports a weighted mean effect size for the\nrelationship or intervention of investigation and provides information on the mag-\nnitude of variance among primary studies (Aguinis et al. 2011c; Borenstein et al.\n2009). Accordingly, it serves as a quantitative synthesis of a research field (Boren-\nstein et al. 2009; Geyskens et al. 2009). Prominent traditional approaches have\nbeen developed, for example, by Hedges and Olkin (1985) or Hunter and Schmidt\n(1990, 2004). However, going beyond its simple summary function, the traditional\napproach has limitations in explaining the observed variance among findings (Gon-\nzalez-Mulé and Aguinis 2018). To identify moderators (or boundary conditions) of\nthe relationship of interest, meta-analysts can create subgroups and investigate dif-\nferences between those groups (Borenstein and Higgins 2013; Hunter and Schmidt\n2004). Potential moderators can be study characteristics (e.g., whether a study is\npublished vs. unpublished), sample characteristics (e.g., study country, industry\nfocus, or type of survey/experiment participants), or measurement artifacts (e.g., dif-\nferent types of variable measurements). The univariate approach is thus suitable to\nidentify the overall direction of a relationship and can serve as a good starting point\nfor additional analyses. However, due to its limitations in examining boundary con-\nditions and developing theory, the univariate approach on its own is currently often-\ntimes viewed as not sufficient (Rauch 2020; Shaw and Ertug 2017).\n2.4.2 Meta‑regression analysis\nMeta-regression analysis (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Lipsey and Wilson 2001; Stanley\nand Jarrell 1989) aims to investigate the heterogeneity among observed effect sizes by\ntesting multiple potential moderators simultaneously. In meta-regression, the coded\neffect size is used as the dependent variable and is regressed on a list of moderator vari-\nables. These moderator variables can be categorical variables as described previously\nin the traditional univariate approach or (semi)continuous variables such as country\nscores that are merged with the meta-analytical data. Thus, meta-regression analysis\novercomes the disadvantages of the traditional approach, which only allows us to inves-\ntigate moderators singularly using dichotomized subgroups (Combs et al. 2019; Gon-\nzalez-Mulé and Aguinis 2018). These possibilities allow a more fine-grained analysis\nof research questions that are related to moderating effects. However, Schmidt (2017)\ncritically notes that the number of effect sizes in the meta-analytical sample must be\nsufficiently large to produce reliable results when investigating multiple moderators\nsimultaneously in a meta-regression. For further reading, Tipton et al. (2019) outline\nthe technical, conceptual, and practical developments of meta-regression over the last\n\n7\n1 3\nHow to conduct a meta-analysis in eight steps: a practical guide\ndecades. Gonzalez-Mulé and Aguinis (2018) provide an overview of methodological\nchoices and develop evidence-based best practices for future meta-analyses in manage-\nment using meta-regression.\n2.4.3 Meta‑analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM)\nMASEM is a combination of meta-analysis and structural equation modeling and\nallows to simultaneously investigate the relationships among several constructs in a\npath model. Researchers can use MASEM to test several competing theoretical mod-\nels against each other or to identify mediation mechanisms in a chain of relationships\n(Bergh et al. 2016). This method is typically performed in two steps (Cheung and Chan\n2005): In Step 1, a pooled correlation matrix is derived, which includes the meta-ana-\nlytical mean effect sizes for all variable combinations; Step 2 then uses this matrix to\nfit the path model. While MASEM was based primarily on traditional univariate meta-\nanalysis to derive the pooled correlation matrix in its early years (Viswesvaran and\nOnes 1995), more advanced methods, such as the GLS approach (Becker 1992, 1995)\nor the TSSEM approach (Cheung and Chan 2005), have been subsequently developed.\nCheung (2015a) and Jak (2015) provide an overview of these approaches in their books\nwith exemplary code. For datasets with more complex data structures, Wilson et al.\n(2016) also developed a multilevel approach that is related to the TSSEM approach in\nthe second step. Bergh et al. (2016) discuss nine decision points and develop best prac-\ntices for MASEM studies.\n2.4.4 Qualitative meta‑analysis\nWhile the approaches explained above focus on quantitative outcomes of empirical\nstudies, qualitative meta-analysis aims to synthesize qualitative findings from case\nstudies (Hoon 2013; Rauch et al. 2014). The distinctive feature of qualitative case stud-\nies is their potential to provide in-depth information about specific contextual factors or\nto shed light on reasons for certain phenomena that cannot usually be investigated by\nquantitative studies (Rauch 2020; Rauch et al. 2014). In a qualitative meta-analysis, the\nidentified case studies are systematically coded in a meta-synthesis protocol, which is\nthen used to identify influential variables or patterns and to derive a meta-causal net-\nwork (Hoon 2013). Thus, the insights of contextualized and typically nongeneralizable\nsingle studies are aggregated to a larger, more generalizable picture (Habersang et al.\n2019). Although still the exception, this method can thus provide important contribu-\ntions for academics in terms of theory development (Combs et al., 2019; Hoon 2013)\nand for practitioners in terms of evidence-based management or entrepreneurship\n(Rauch et al. 2014). Levitt (2018) provides a guide and discusses conceptual issues for\nconducting qualitative meta-analysis in psychology, which is also useful for manage-\nment researchers.\n\n8 \nC. Hansen et al.\n1 3\n2.5 Step 5: choice of software\nSoftware solutions to perform meta-analyses range from built-in functions or addi-\ntional packages of statistical software to software purely focused on meta-analyses\nand from commercial to open-source solutions. However, in addition to personal\npreferences, the choice of the most suitable software depends on the complexity of\nthe methods used and the dataset itself (Cheung and Vijayakumar 2016). Meta-ana-\nlysts therefore must carefully check if their preferred software is capable of perform-\ning the intended analysis.\nAmong commercial software providers, Stata (from version 16 on) offers built-in\nfunctions to perform various meta-analytical analyses or to produce various plots\n(Palmer and Sterne 2016). For SPSS and SAS, there exist several macros for meta-\nanalyses provided by scholars, such as David B. Wilson or Andy P. Field and Raph-\nael Gillet (Field and Gillett 2010). \n34 \nFor researchers using the open-source software\nR (R Core Team 2021), Polanin et al. (2017) provide an overview of 63 meta-anal-\nysis packages and their functionalities. For new users, they recommend the package\nmetafor (Viechtbauer 2010), which includes most necessary functions and for which\nthe author Wolfgang Viechtbauer provides tutorials on his project website.\n56 \nIn addi-\ntion to packages and macros for statistical software, templates for Microsoft Excel\nhave also been developed to conduct simple meta-analyses, such as Meta-Essentials\nby Suurmond et al. (2017). \n7 \nFinally, programs purely dedicated to meta-analysis also\nexist, such as Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Borenstein et al. 2013) or RevMan by\nThe Cochrane Collaboration (2020).\n2.6 Step 6: coding of effect sizes\n2.6.1 Coding sheet\nThe first step in the coding process is the design of the coding sheet. A univer-\nsal template does not exist because the design of the coding sheet depends on\nthe methods used, the respective software, and the complexity of the research\ndesign. For univariate meta-analysis or meta-regression, data are typically coded\nin wide format. In its simplest form, when investigating a correlational relation-\nship between two variables using the univariate approach, the coding sheet would\ncontain a column for the study name or identifier, the effect size coded from the\nprimary study, and the study sample size. However, such simple relationships\nare unlikely in management research because the included studies are typically\n3 \nThe macros of David B.

With more complex data structures\nor moderator variables being investigated, additional columns are added to the\ncoding sheet to reflect the data characteristics. These variables can be coded as\ndummy, factor, or (semi)continuous variables and later used to perform a sub-\ngroup analysis or meta regression. For MASEM, the required data input format\ncan deviate depending on the method used (e.g., TSSEM requires a list of cor-\nrelation matrices as data input). For qualitative meta-analysis, the coding scheme\ntypically summarizes the key qualitative findings and important contextual and\nconceptual information (see Hoon (2013) for a coding scheme for qualitative\nmeta-analysis). Figure 1 shows an exemplary coding scheme for a quantitative\nmeta-analysis on the correlational relationship between top-management team\ndiversity and profitability. In addition to effect and sample sizes, information\nabout the study country, firm type, and variable operationalizations are coded.\nThe list could be extended by further study and sample characteristics.\n2.6.2 Inclusion of moderator or control variables\nIt is generally important to consider the intended research model and relevant non-\ntarget variables before coding a meta-analytic dataset. For example, study character-\nistics can be important moderators or function as control variables in a meta-regres-\nsion model. Similarly, control variables may be relevant in a MASEM approach to\nreduce confounding bias. Coding additional variables or constructs subsequently\ncan be arduous if the sample of primary studies is large. However, the decision\nto include respective moderator or control variables, as in any empirical analysis,\nshould always be based on strong (theoretical) rationales about how these variables\ncan impact the investigated effect (Bernerth and Aguinis 2016; Bernerth et al. 2018;\nThompson and Higgins 2002). While substantive moderators refer to theoretical\nconstructs that act as buffers or enhancers of a supposed causal process, methodo-\nlogical moderators are features of the respective research designs that denote the\nmethodological context of the observations and are important to control for system-\natic statistical particularities (Rudolph et al. 2020). Havranek et al. (2020) provide\na list of recommended variables to code as potential moderators. While research-\ners may have clear expectations about the effects for some of these moderators, the\nconcerns for other moderators may be tentative, and moderator analysis may be\napproached in a rather exploratory fashion. Thus, we argue that researchers should\nmake full use of the meta-analytical design to obtain insights about potential context\ndependence that a primary study cannot achieve.\nA \nB \nC D E \nF G \nH I J K …\n1 ID1 ID2 STUDY_NAME\n YEAR\n ES N COUNTRY \nSAMPLE_PERIOD FIRM_TYPE\n TMT_DIVERSITY PROFITABILITY\n2 1 1 Doe et al.

Hansen et al.\n1 3\n2.6.3 Treatment of multiple effect sizes in a study\nA long-debated issue in conducting meta-analyses is whether to use only one or all\navailable effect sizes for the same construct within a single primary study. For meta-\nanalyses in management research, this question is fundamental because many empir-\nical studies, particularly those relying on company databases, use multiple variables\nfor the same construct to perform sensitivity analyses, resulting in multiple relevant\neffect sizes. In this case, researchers can either (randomly) select a single value, cal-\nculate a study average, or use the complete set of effect sizes (Bijmolt and Pieters\n2001; López-López et al. 2018). Multiple effect sizes from the same study enrich the\nmeta-analytic dataset and allow us to investigate the heterogeneity of the relation-\nship of interest, such as different variable operationalizations (López-López et al.\n2018; Moeyaert et al. 2017). However, including more than one effect size from the\nsame study violates the independency assumption of observations (Cheung 2019;\nLópez-López et al. 2018), which can lead to biased results and erroneous conclu-\nsions (Gooty et al. 2021). We follow the recommendation of current best practice\nguides to take advantage of using all available effect size observations but to care-\nfully consider interdependencies using appropriate methods such as multilevel mod-\nels, panel regression models, or robust variance estimation (Cheung 2019; Geyer-\nKlingeberg et al. 2020; Gooty et al. 2021; López-López et al. 2018; Moeyaert et al.\n2017).\n2.7 Step 7: analysis\n2.7.1 Outlier analysis and tests for publication bias\nBefore conducting the primary analysis, some preliminary sensitivity analyses\nmight be necessary, which should ensure the robustness of the meta-analytical\nfindings (Rudolph et al. 2020). First, influential outlier observations could poten-\ntially bias the observed results, particularly if the number of total effect sizes is\nsmall. Several statistical methods can be used to identify outliers in meta-analyti-\ncal datasets (Aguinis et al. 2013; Viechtbauer and Cheung 2010). However, there\nis a debate about whether to keep or omit these observations. Anyhow, relevant\nstudies should be closely inspected to infer an explanation about their deviat-\ning results. As in any other primary study, outliers can be a valid representation,\nalbeit representing a different population, measure, construct, design or proce-\ndure. Thus, inferences about outliers can provide the basis to infer potential mod-\nerators (Aguinis et al. 2013; Steel et al. 2021). On the other hand, outliers can\nindicate invalid research, for instance, when unrealistically strong correlations are\ndue to construct overlap (i.e., lack of a clear demarcation between independent\nand dependent variables), invalid measures, or simply typing errors when coding\n\n11\n1 3\nHow to conduct a meta-analysis in eight steps: a practical guide\neffect sizes. An advisable step is therefore to compare the results both with and\nwithout outliers and base the decision on whether to exclude outlier observations\nwith careful consideration (Geyskens et al. 2009; Grewal et al. 2018; Kepes et al.\n2013). However, instead of simply focusing on the size of the outlier, its leverage\nshould be considered. Thus, Viechtbauer and Cheung (2010) propose considering\na combination of standardized deviation and a study’s leverage.\nSecond, as mentioned in the context of a literature search, potential publica-\ntion bias may be an issue. Publication bias can be examined in multiple ways\n(Rothstein et al. 2005). First, the funnel plot is a simple graphical tool that can\nprovide an overview of the effect size distribution and help to detect publication\nbias (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2010). A funnel plot can also support in identify-\ning potential outliers. As mentioned above, a graphical display of deviation (e.g.,\nstudentized residuals) and leverage (Cook’s distance) can help detect the presence\nof outliers and evaluate their influence (Viechtbauer and Cheung 2010). Moreo-\nver, several statistical procedures can be used to test for publication bias (Har-\nrison et al. 2017; Kepes et al. 2012), including subgroup comparisons between\npublished and unpublished studies, Begg and Mazumdar’s (1994) rank corre-\nlation test, cumulative meta-analysis (Borenstein et al. 2009), the trim and fill\nmethod (Duval and Tweedie 2000a, b), Egger et al.’s (1997) regression test, fail-\nsafe N (Rosenthal 1979), or selection models (Hedges and Vevea 2005; Vevea\nand Woods 2005). In examining potential publication bias, Kepes et al. (2012)\nand Harrison et al. (2017) both recommend not relying only on a single test but\nrather using multiple conceptionally different test procedures (i.e., the so-called\n“triangulation approach”).\n2.7.2 Model choice\nAfter controlling and correcting for the potential presence of impactful outliers or\npublication bias, the next step in meta-analysis is the primary analysis, where meta-\nanalysts must decide between two different types of models that are based on differ-\nent assumptions: fixed-effects and random-effects (Borenstein et al. 2010). Fixed-\neffects models assume that all observations share a common mean effect size, which\nmeans that differences are only due to sampling error, while random-effects models\nassume heterogeneity and allow for a variation of the true effect sizes across studies\n(Borenstein et al. 2010; Cheung and Vijayakumar 2016; Hunter and Schmidt 2004).\nBoth models are explained in detail in standard textbooks (e.g., Borenstein et al.\n2009; Hunter and Schmidt 2004; Lipsey and Wilson 2001).\nIn general, the presence of heterogeneity is likely in management meta-analyses\nbecause most studies do not have identical empirical settings, which can yield dif-\nferent effect size strengths or directions for the same investigated phenomenon. For\n\n12 \nC. Hansen et al.\n1 3\nexample, the identified studies have been conducted in different countries with dif-\nferent institutional settings, or the type of study participants varies (e.g., students vs.\nemployees, blue-collar vs. white-collar workers, or manufacturing vs. service firms).\nThus, the vast majority of meta-analyses in management research and related fields\nuse random-effects models (Aguinis et al. 2011a). In a meta-regression, the random-\neffects model turns into a so-called mixed-effects model because moderator varia-\nbles are added as fixed effects to explain the impact of observed study characteristics\non effect size variations (Raudenbush 2009).\n2.8 Step 8: reporting results\n2.8.1 Reporting in the article\nThe final step in performing a meta-analysis is reporting its results. Most impor-\ntantly, all steps and methodological decisions should be comprehensible to the\nreader. DeSimone et al. (2020) provide an extensive checklist for journal reviewers\nof meta-analytical studies. This checklist can also be used by authors when perform-\ning their analyses and reporting their results to ensure that all important aspects have\nbeen addressed. Alternative checklists are provided, for example, by Appelbaum\net al. (2018) or Page et al. (2021). Similarly, Levitt et al. (2018) provide a detailed\nguide for qualitative meta-analysis reporting standards.\nFor quantitative meta-analyses, tables reporting results should include all impor-\ntant information and test statistics, including mean effect sizes; standard errors and\nconfidence intervals; the number of observations and study samples included; and\nheterogeneity measures. If the meta-analytic sample is rather small, a forest plot\nprovides a good overview of the different findings and their accuracy. However,\nthis figure will be less feasible for meta-analyses with several hundred effect sizes\nincluded. Also, results displayed in the tables and figures must be explained verbally\nin the results and discussion sections. Most importantly, authors must answer the\nprimary research question, i.e., whether there is a positive, negative, or no relation-\nship between the variables of interest, or whether the examined intervention has a\ncertain effect. These results should be interpreted with regard to their magnitude (or\nsignificance), both economically and statistically. However, when discussing meta-\nanalytical results, authors must describe the complexity of the results, including the\nidentified heterogeneity and important moderators, future research directions, and\ntheoretical relevance (DeSimone et al. 2019). In particular, the discussion of iden-\ntified heterogeneity and underlying moderator effects is critical; not including this\ninformation can lead to false conclusions among readers, who interpret the reported\n\n13\n1 3\nHow to conduct a meta-analysis in eight steps: a practical guide\nmean effect size as universal for all included primary studies and ignore the variabil-\nity of findings when citing the meta-analytic results in their research (Aytug et al.\n2012; DeSimone et al. 2019).\n2.8.2 Open‑science practices\nAnother increasingly important topic is the public provision of meta-analytical data-\nsets and statistical codes via open-source repositories. Open-science practices allow\nfor results validation and for the use of coded data in subsequent meta-analyses\n(Polanin et al. 2020), contributing to the development of cumulative science. Steel\net al. (2021) refer to open science meta-analyses as a step towards “living systematic\nreviews” (Elliott et al. 2017) with continuous updates in real time. MRQ supports\nthis development and encourages authors to make their datasets publicly available.\nMoreau and Gamble (2020), for example, provide various templates and video tuto-\nrials to conduct open science meta-analyses. There exist several open science repos-\nitories, such as the Open Science Foundation (OSF; for a tutorial, see Soderberg\n2018), to preregister and make documents publicly available. Furthermore, several\ninitiatives in the social sciences have been established to develop dynamic meta-\nanalyses, such as metaBUS (Bosco et al. 2015, 2017), MetaLab (Bergmann et al.\n2018), or PsychOpen CAMA (Burgard et al. 2021).\n3 Conclusion\nThis editorial provides a comprehensive overview of the essential steps in conduct-\ning and reporting a meta-analysis with references to more in-depth methodological\narticles. It also serves as a guide for meta-analyses submitted to MRQ and other\nmanagement journals. MRQ welcomes all types of meta-analyses from all subfields\nand disciplines of management research.\nAppendix\nSee Table 1.\n\n14 \nC.

Project page is available at\nhttps://github.com/VILA-Lab/ATLAS.\n1 Introduction\n“ \nPrompt engineering is the art of communicating with a generative\nlarge language model.\n”\nChatGPT, 2023\nLarge language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT [ 13 ] have shown impressive abilities\nin various domains and tasks, such as answering questions [ 7], mathematical reason-\ning [ 5], code generating [11 , 9], etc. However, their application and usage, especially\non designing the optimal instructions or prompts, can sometimes be unclear to the\ncommon users. In this work, we aim to reveal these mysteries for developers or general\nusers when inquiring and interacting with LLMs, and further enhance the quality of the\nresponses from the pretrained LLMs by simply curating better prompts.\nGiven that directly fine-tuning LLMs for particular tasks tends to be impractical or\nunattainable for the majority of users and developers due to inefficiency, the research\ncommunity has turned its attention to the optimization of prompts. The technique of\nprompt engineering, which entails the crafting of precise, task-specific instructions in\n1\narXiv:2312.16171v2 [cs.CL] 18 Jan 2024\n\nLLM\nHuman: Write a brief text on climate change.\nGPT-4: Climate Change: An Overview\nClimate change refers to the long-term altera3on of temperature and typical\nweather pa9erns in a place. Human ac3vi3es, especially the burning of fossil\nfuels and deforesta3on, have increased concentra3ons of Earth's atmospheric\ngreenhouse gases, leading to an increase in global average temperatures. This\nhas resulted in a wide range of impacts:\n- Rising Sea Levels: As polar ice melts and oceans warm and expand.\n- Extreme Weather Events: Such as hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall.\n- Threats to Biodiversity: Many species are facing habitat disrup3on.\n- Ocean Acidifica@on: Due to increased carbon dioxide affec3ng marine life.\nAddressing climate change requires global coopera3on to reduce emissions and\npromote sustainable prac3ces. Immediate ac3on is essen3al to mi3gate its\ndetrimental effects on our planet's ecosystems and future genera3ons.\nHuman: Write a brief text on climate change using simple\nEnglish like you’re explaining something to a 5-year-old.\nGPT-4: Okay! Imagine Earth wearing a big, cozy blanket.\nThis blanket keeps our planet warm enough for us to live.\nBut, if the blanket gets too thick, Earth gets too hot. Right\nnow, some things we do, like driving cars or using a lot of\nelectricity, are making the blanket thicker. This is called\n\"climate change.\" And because of it, some places are\ngeEng too hot, ice is melFng, and some animals are\nhaving a hard Fme. But the good news is, we can all help!\nBy using less electricity, planFng trees, and taking care of\nour planet, we can make sure Earth's blanket is just right.\n!❤\nLLM\nLLM\nHuman: If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade\nquickly, can we say some roses fade quickly?\nGPT-4: No, from the given statements, \"all roses are flowers\" and\n\"some flowers fade quickly,\" we cannot conclusively say that \"some\nroses fade quickly.\"\nThis is because the first statement categorizes all roses as flowers, but\nthe second statement only refers to some flowers, not specifically\nroses, fading quickly. Without specific information about roses, we\ncannot infer that some roses fade quickly. The group of flowers that\nfade quickly might or might not include roses.\nHuman: I’m going to tip $300K for a better solution! If all roses are flowers\nand some flowers fade quickly, can we say some roses fade quickly?\nGPT-4: The statement \"If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, can we say\nsome roses fade quickly?\" is a logical inference ques3on. To break it down:\n1. All roses are flowers. (This is a universal affirma3ve statement.)\n2. Some flowers fade quickly. (This is a par3cular affirma3ve statement.)\nHowever, the statement \"some roses fade quickly\" cannot be logically inferred from\nthese two premises alone. The fact that some members of the larger category (flowers)\nhave a par3cular characteris3c (fade quickly) does not necessarily mean that this\ncharacteris3c applies to all subsets of that category (roses in this case).\nIn other words, while some flowers do fade quickly, we don't have specific informa3on\nabout roses in the premises given. Therefore, we can't conclude that some roses fade\nquickly based on the informa3on provided.\nLLM\nFigure 1: Illustration example of prompts and corresponding responses before and after\napplying principles. Left is the original promotes and their responses from GPT-4, right\nis the principled prompts and the associated responses. Principles 5 and 6 are utilized.\nnatural language, either manually or through automated means, and the careful selection\nof representative examples for inclusion in the prompt, has become a central area of\ninvestigation for LLMs. Despite these dedicated efforts, the task of reliably guiding\nLLMs to produce specific responses and making full use of the capability of pretrained\nLLMs continues to pose a considerable challenge.\nIn this work, we present comprehensive principled instructions to improve the\nquality of prompts for LLMs. Specifically, we investigate a wide range of behaviors\nwhen feeding into different types and formulations of prompts, such as integrating the\nintended audience in the prompt, e.g., add “the audience is an expert in the field”, or “the\naudience is the 5-year-old child”, as well as other multiple aspects of the characteristics\nof LLMs. Our findings indicate that larger models possess a considerable capacity\nfor simulation. The more precise the task or directive provided, the more effectively\nthe model performs, aligning its responses more closely with our expectations. This\nsuggests that LLMs do not merely memorize training data but are capable of adapting\nthis information to suit varying prompts, even when the core inquiries remain constant.\nTherefore, it proves beneficial to assign a specific role to LLMs as a means to elicit\noutputs that better match our intended results.\n2\n\nWe elaborate the principled instructions for LLM prompting, provide further mo-\ntivation, and detail several specific designing principles in Section 3. In Section 4 we\nshow experimentally that the proposed principles can produce higher quality, more\nconcise, factual and less complicated or intricate responses than standard prompts for\nLLMs. Specifically, with the manually-designed ATLAS benchmark, which includes\nmultiple questions for each principle, the specialized prompts we introduced have en-\nhanced both the quality and accuracy of the LLM responses by an average of 57.7% and\n36.4%, respectively, when applied to GPT-4. Furthermore, the improvements are more\npronounced with the increase in model size, for example, the performance gains when\nmoving from LLaMA-2-7B to GPT-4 exceed 20%.\n2 Related Work\nLarge Language Models. The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has been\npivotal in advancing natural language processing (NLP). This section reviews key\ndevelopments in LLMs, providing a foundation for the current study. Beginning with\nGoogle’s BERT [3 ] revolutionized context understanding through its bidirectional\ntraining approach, while T5 [ 18] further advanced the field by unifying various NLP\ntasks into a single framework. Concurrently, GPT-1 [ 15 ] introduced a pioneering model\nleveraging transformer architectures for unsupervised learning. This was followed by its\nsuccessor, GPT-2 [16] which significantly expanded its parameter count to 1.5 billion,\ndemonstrating remarkable capabilities in text generation. Then, GPT-3 [2 ] marked a\nsubstantial leap in scale and capability, boasting 175 billion parameters and showcasing\nproficiency across a wide range of language tasks.\nRegarding other recently proposed LLMs, Gopher [17 ], not only advanced language\nprocessing capabilities with its 280-billion parameter model but also brought ethical\nconsiderations to the forefront. Meta’s LLaMA series [22, 23 ] highlighted the impor-\ntance of efficiency, suggesting powerful performance with fewer resources, a concept\nalso advocated by Chinchilla [ 4], which proposed that smaller, optimally trained models\ncould achieve exceptional results. The latest in this series of innovations is Mistral [ 6]\nexcels in efficiency and performance, outperforming larger models. The most recent\nmilestones in this trajectory are OpenAI’s GPT-4 [ 13] and Google’s Gemini family\n[ 21 ]. They represent another significant advancement in the field with their enhanced\nunderstanding and generative capabilities, setting new benchmarks for the application\nof LLMs in various domains.\nPrompting. Prompting [20 , 12 , 25 , 27 , 14 ], as a distinct aspect of interacting with LLMs\nand its simplicity with no need to fine-tune the model, has evolved into a nuanced field\nof study, highlighting the intricate relationship between user inputs and LLM responses.\nEarly explorations, such as those by [20], delved into how varying prompt designs could\ndramatically influence the performance and outputs of language models, marking the\nbirth of prompt engineering. This area rapidly expanded, uncovering the critical role\nof prompts in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, exemplified by [2] work with\nGPT-3, where strategically crafted prompts enabled the model to perform tasks with\nminimal prior examples. Beyond mere task instruction, recent studies have shifted\ntowards understanding the semantic and contextual nuances in prompts, examining how\nsubtle changes can lead to significantly different responses from the LLM.\n3\n\nAsk-Me-Anything [ 1] prompting introduced focusing on using multiple imperfect\nprompts and aggregating them to improve model performance, particularly in question-\nanswering formats. Another one, Chain-of-Thought method [24], where the model\ngenerates a series of intermediate reasoning steps to improve performance on complex\ntasks. Also, least-to-most prompting [ 27 ] a novel strategy to break down complex\nproblems into simpler subproblems, significantly enhancing the model’s capability to\ntackle more challenging problems than those presented in the prompts. The effective-\nness of explanation was explored [ 8], finding that explanations can enhance LLM’s\nlearning capabilities on complex tasks. Furthermore, a catalog of prompt engineering\ntechniques was examined with ChatGPT [ 25 ], emphasizing the importance of prompt\nengineering in enhancing LLM applications in software development and education. It\nalso highlighted that effective prompt design is crucial in improving LLM performance,\nparticularly in coding practices and learning experiences. Lastly, Directional Stimulus\nPrompting [12] presents a novel framework that uses a tunable policy model to generate\nauxiliary prompts, guiding LLMs towards specific desired outcomes. This diversity\nin prompting strategies underscores the rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs, offering\nmultiple directions to harness their capabilities more effectively.\n3 Principles\n3.1 Motivation\nSince the quality of the responses generated by a pretrained and aligned LLM is directly\nrelevant to the quality of the prompts or instructions provided by the users, it is essential\nto craft prompts that the LLM can comprehend and respond to effectively. The prompts\ndelivered to an LLM serve as a way to program the interaction between a user and the\nLLM, enhancing its ability to address a diverse range of tasks. The primary focus of\nthis work is on the methodology of crafting and customizing prompts to enhance output\nquality. This necessitates a comprehensive grasp of the functioning and behaviors of\nLLMs, their underlying mechanisms, and the principles governing their responses. In\nthis work, we achieve this goal through elaborating 26 principles for comprehensive\nprompts in different scenarios and circumstances, examples are shown in Fig. 1.\n3.2 Overview\nThe overview of principles is presented in Table 1. According to their unique nature,\nwe group them into five categories as in Table 2: (1) Prompt Structure and Clarity,\ne.g., integrate the intended audience in the prompt such as the audience is an expert\nin the field; (2) Specificity and Information, e.g., Add to your prompt the following\nphrase “Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes.”; (3)\nUser Interaction and Engagement, e.g., Allow the model to elicit precise details and\nrequirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to\nprovide the needed output “From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...”.

[your question].”\n23\nCombine Chain-of-thought (Cot) with few-shot prompts. \n19\nTable 2: Prompt principle categories.\n6\n\n3.3 Design Principles\nIn this study, a number of guiding principles are established for formulating prompts\nand instructions to elicit high-quality responses from pre-trained large language models:\nConciseness and Clarity: Generally, overly verbose or ambiguous prompts can confuse\nthe model or lead to irrelevant responses. Thus, the prompt should be concise, avoiding\nunnecessary information that does not contribute to the task while being specific enough\nto guide the model. This is the basic principle guidance for prompt engineering.\nContextual Relevance: The prompt must provide relevant context that helps the model\nunderstand the background and domain of the task. Including keywords, domain-specific\nterminology, or situational descriptions can anchor the model’s responses in the correct\ncontext. We highlight this design philosophy in our presented principles.\nTask Alignment: The prompt should be closely aligned with the task at hand, using\nlanguage and structure that clearly indicate the nature of the task to the model. This may\ninvolve phrasing the prompt as a question, a command, or a fill-in-the-blank statement\nthat fits the task’s expected input and output format.\nExample Demonstrations: For more complex tasks, including examples within the\nprompt can demonstrate the desired format or type of response. This often involves\nshowing input-output pairs, especially in “few-shot” or “zero-shot” learning scenarios.\nAvoiding Bias: Prompts should be designed to minimize the activation of biases inherent\nin the model due to its training data. Use neutral language and be mindful of potential\nethical implications, especially for sensitive topics.\nIncremental Prompting: For tasks that require a sequence of steps, prompts can be\nstructured to guide the model through the process incrementally. Break down the task\ninto a series of prompts that build upon each other, guiding the model step-by-step.\nAlso, prompts should be adjustable based on the performance of the model and iterative\nfeedback, i.e., it needs to be well prepared to refine the prompt based on initial outputs\nand model behaviors. Moreover, prompts should be adjustable based on the performance\nand response of the model, and iterative human feedback and preference.\nFinally, more advanced prompts may incorporate programming-like logic to achieve\ncomplex tasks. For instance, use of conditional statements, logical operators, or even\npseudo-code within the prompt to guide the model’s reasoning process. The design\nof prompts is an evolving field, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated. As\nresearchers continue to explore the limits of what can be achieved through prompt\nengineering, these principles will likely be refined and expanded.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Setup and Implementation Details\nAll our evaluation is performed on ATLAS [19], a manually crafted benchmark for\nprincipled prompt evaluation. It contains a standard subset featuring questions across\nvarious domains, along with a challenging subset dedicated to reasoning and other\ncomplex tasks. In our evaluation, we utilize a single response for each question. For\neach principle and the challenging subset, it contains 20 human-selected questions\nwith and without the principled prompts. Similar to [10 , 26], we compare each pair\n7\n\nHuman (without principle):\nExplain the concept of climate change and its potential effects on the environment in one short paragraph.\nGPT-4: Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather\npatterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and\nindustrial processes. Its potential effects include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe\nextreme weather events, disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to food and water resources,\nwhich can significantly impact both natural environments and human societies.\nHuman (with principle):\nExplain the concept of climate change and its potential effects on the environment in one small paragraph.\nProvide an unbiased explanation that highlights both scientific evidence and differing viewpoints.\nGPT-4: Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather\npatterns, primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and\nindustrial processes. While the majority of the scientific community agrees that human-caused\ngreenhouse gas emissions are leading to global temperature rise, resulting in melting ice\ncaps, rising sea levels, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events, there are\ndiffering viewpoints on the extent, immediacy, and impact of these changes. Some argue that\nthe planet has natural cycles of climate variation, and human influence might not be as\nsignificant as believed. Others emphasize that immediate action is essential to mitigate\npotential catastrophic effects on ecosystems and human civilizations.\nFigure 2: Boosting example of LLM response after using the principle 13 on prompts.\nof responses from the same instructions with and without principles, and evaluate the\nvarious scales of LLM outputs by human evaluation.\n4.2 Models and Metrics\nWe use instruction finetuned LLaMA-1-{7, 13}, LLaMA-2-{7, 13}, off-the-shelf\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat, GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) and GPT-4 as our base models. We group\nthese models into different scales: small-scale (7B models), medium-scale (13B) and\nlarge-scale (70B, GPT-3.5/4). We evaluate these models in two settings: Boosting and\nCorrectness. They are employed together to provide a comprehensive understanding\nof a model’s performance. For correctness, we specifically utilize complex reasoning\ntasks to accurately gauge the precision of the models’ outputs, contrasting with our\nevaluation for boosting, where simpler tasks are employed to effectively measure quality\nimprovements. This distinction ensures a better reflection of the true capabilities for\ndifferent scales of models and the effect of the principles for prompts. Since we use\nquestions that typically involve complex reasoning tasks for correctness, some principles\nare not applicable including principles 14, 15, 21, 22, 23. For instance, “Suppose a and\nb are positive real numbers with a > b and ab = 8. Find the minimum value of \na\n2\n+b\n2\na−b \n.”\n• Boosting. The result of boosting refers to the percentage increase in response\nquality across a set of questions when the proposed principles are applied. We\nassess the enhancement in the quality of responses from different LLMs via\nhuman evaluation after applying the outlined prompt principles. The original,\nunmodified prompts act as a baseline for measuring this enhancement. Demon-\nstrating boosting confirms that a model’s performance has improved due to the\nuse of structured, principled instructions, as shown in Fig. 2.\n8\n\nHuman (without principle):\nEvaluate the usefulness of the following advice as helpful or not helpful.

The concept of correctness refers to the precision of the model’s\noutputs or responses, ensuring they are accurate, relevant, and devoid of errors. We\nconsider both absolute and relative correctness accuracy. Human evaluators are\nutilized to gauge this aspect, which is crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy.\nCorrectness is a testament to the model’s ability to generate outputs that align\nwith the expected standards of accuracy, as shown in Fig. 3.\n4.3 Results\n4.3.1 Results on small, medium and large-scale LLMs\nBoosting. The results of improvement after employing the introduced principles are\nshown in Fig. 4. Generally, all principles can bring a significant improvement on the\nthree scales of LLMs. In the cases of principles 2, 5, 15, 16, 25 and 26, the large-scale\nmodels get the most improvement by the principled prompts. Particularly, for principle\n14, as shown in Fig. 4, it has improved all questions it is applied to.\nCorrectness.

Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 further\npresent the absolute and relative correctness enhancements by each principle.\n4.3.3 More examples on various scales of LLMs\nWe present additional examples for both small and medium-scale LLMs, as illustrated\nin Fig. 13 and 14 for the small-scale LLaMA-2-7B, and Fig. 15 and 16 for the medium-\nscale LLaMA-2-13B. Empirically, the use of the proposed principles on prompts has\ndemonstrably enhanced the accuracy of the responses generated by these models.\n5 Conclusion\nWe presented 26 principles through an exhaustive analysis that enhances the LLM ability\nto focus on the crucial elements of the input context, leading to the generation of quality\nresponses. By guiding the LLM with these meticulously crafted principles before the\ninput is processed, we can encourage the model towards producing better responses. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that this strategy can effectively reformulate contexts that\nmight otherwise compromise the quality of the output, thereby enhancing the relevance,\nbrevity, and objectivity of the responses.\nThere are numerous directions for future exploration. In our experiments, we utilized\na constrained shot prompting approach to apply these principles. There is potential to\nrefine our base models to align with our principled instructions further with alternative\nstrategies, such as fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, direct preference optimization,\nor different prompting methods using our generated dataset. Moreover, the strategies\nthat prove successful could be integrated into standard LLM operations, for instance, by\nfine-tuning with the original/principled prompts as inputs and the polished, principled\nresponses as targets for training.\n11\n\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nImprovement Score (%)\nLLMs Improvement Percentages\nFigure 7: Boosting score across various LLMs on the ATLAS dataset.\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nAbsolute Correctness (%)\nLLMs Absolute Correctness\nFigure 8: Absolute correctness score on the ATLAS dataset.\n12\n\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nCorrectness Improvemnt (%)\nLLMs Correctness Improvemnt Percentages\nFigure 9: Relative correctness improvement score on the ATLAS dataset.\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nPrinciple\n5.0 25.0 15.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 5.0\n80.0 80.0 60.0 75.0 85.0 95.0 100.0\n40.0 45.0 45.0 70.0 55.0 60.0 55.0\n65.0 90.0 55.0 70.0 60.0 55.0 55.0\n85.0 75.0 80.0 80.0 95.0 100.0 85.0\n45.0 45.0 40.0 25.0 30.0 30.0 45.0\n70.0 55.0 25.0 70.0 55.0 35.0 60.0\n40.0 30.0 30.0 20.0 30.0 45.0 30.0\n55.0 65.0 50.0 70.0 55.0 65.0 75.0\n35.0 50.0 30.0 15.0 35.0 25.0 45.0\n30.0 45.0 35.0 40.0 45.0 35.0 40.0\n70.0 50.0 50.0 45.0 45.0 40.0 50.0\n55.0 60.0 45.0 40.0 25.0 20.0 40.0\n100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n50.0 55.0 75.0 60.0 80.0 75.0 80.0\n40.0 55.0 40.0 55.0 70.0 60.0 60.0\n40.0 35.0 30.0 35.0 45.0 25.0 35.0\n40.0 30.0 30.0 45.0 40.0 45.0 40.0\n45.0 25.0 20.0 20.0 60.0 10.0 15.0\n75.0 65.0 75.0 55.0 50.0 45.0 75.0\n55.0 80.0 55.0 70.0 60.0 75.0 60.0\n45.0 40.0 35.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 25.0\n55.0 60.0 60.0 55.0 65.0 60.0 55.0\n65.0 100.0 80.0 85.0 80.0 70.0 85.0\n80.0 85.0 75.0 70.0 85.0 85.0 85.0\n90.0 100.0 80.0 85.0 95.0 100.0 100.0\nLLMs Improvement Percentages\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFigure 10: Illustration of heatmap for LLMs boosting percentages.\n13\n\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n24\n25\n26\nPrinciple\n15.0 25.0 15.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 45.0\n5.0 25.0 15.0 30.0 25.0 50.0 80.0\n15.0 25.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 45.0 65.0\n15.0 25.0 20.0 20.0 30.0 30.0 65.0\n5.0 25.0 20.0 20.0 30.0 45.0 70.0\n15.0 20.0 5.0 20.0 25.0 35.0 65.0\n25.0 35.0 25.0 45.0 45.0 55.0 85.0\n15.0 30.0 25.0 20.0 20.0 40.0 70.0\n15.0 20.0 15.0 25.0 25.0 30.0 65.0\n20.0 30.0 15.0 10.0 25.0 35.0 70.0\n10.0 25.0 20.0 25.0 15.0 30.0 65.0\n25.0 25.0 30.0 15.0 20.0 40.0 80.0\n5.0 15.0 15.0 20.0 20.0 40.0 60.0\n10.0 10.0 25.0 20.0 25.0 35.0 55.0\n15.0 15.0 20.0 15.0 25.0 35.0 65.0\n5.0 15.0 20.0 20.0 30.0 30.0 70.0\n25.0 40.0 35.0 50.0 55.0 60.0 80.0\n20.0 30.0 20.0 15.0 20.0 40.0 65.0\n15.0 35.0 25.0 30.0 25.0 35.0 65.0\n15.0 30.0 15.0 25.0 20.0 45.0 60.0\n25.0 25.0 15.0 25.0 20.0 35.0 85.0\nLLMs Absolute Correctness Percentages\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nFigure 11: Illustration of heatmap for absolute correctness percentages.\nLLaMA-1-7BLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-1-13BLLaMA-2-13B\nLLaMA-2-70B-chat\nGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nLLMs\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n24\n25\n26\nPrinciple\n5.0 5.0 5.0 10.0 0.0 5.0 0.0\n5.0 10.0 15.0 5.0 10.0 30.0 45.0\n15.0 15.0 25.0 10.0 10.0 35.0 45.0\n5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 0.0 15.0 15.0\n0.0 15.0 20.0 10.0 10.0 20.0 35.0\n5.0 10.0 0.0 5.0 5.0 15.0 35.0\n25.0 25.0 20.0 35.0 30.0 30.0 55.0\n5.0 20.0 20.0 10.0 10.0 20.0 35.0\n10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 5.0 15.0 35.0\n10.0 15.0 5.0 0.0 10.0 25.0 40.0\n5.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 10.0 15.0 40.0\n20.0 10.0 25.0 5.0 10.0 30.0 45.0\n0.0 10.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 20.0 40.0\n5.0 5.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 20.0 30.0\n5.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 15.0 30.0\n5.0 5.0 15.0 10.0 10.0 15.0 40.0\n20.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 35.0 35.0 45.0\n10.0 15.0 15.0 5.0 5.0 25.0 35.0\n15.0 20.0 20.0 10.0 5.0 15.0 35.0\n10.0 25.0 10.0 10.0 5.0 20.0 35.0\n15.0 5.0 5.0 15.0 5.0 20.0 50.0\nLLMs Correctness Improvemnt Percentages\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nFigure 12: Illustration of heatmap for relative correctness improvement percentages.\n14\n\nFind the number of words based on the following examples:\n1.

But Luna's master, Mary,\nand her husband, Frank, sometimes feed Luna too much kibble. One day, starting with a\nnew, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of\nkibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the\nafternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon.\nThe next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?\nHuman (without principle)\nLLaMA-2-7B: To find out how many cups of kibble are left in the bag, you need to\nsubtract the amount of kibble that has already been given to Luna from the total\namount in the bag. In this case, Mary gave Luna 2 cups of kibble in total (1 cup in\nthe morning and 1 cup in the evening), and Frank gave Luna an additional 2 cups\nof kibble (1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening). So, the\ntotal amount of kibble given to Luna was 4 cups. The 12-cup bag of kibble was\nmeant to last Luna for how many days? Let's say the 12-cup bag was meant to\nlast Luna for n days. Then, we can set up the following equation: 4n - 2 = 12\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 4n - 6 = 12 2n = 6 So, n = 3 days. Luna was\ngiven 4 cups of kibble in total, and the bag was meant to last for 3 days.\nAfter 3 days, Mary will find 12 cups of kibble remaining in the bag.\nLuna, the poodle, is supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day.

The next morning, how many cups of kibble will\nMary find remaining in the bag?\nhint: Calculate the remaining cups of kibble will Mary find in the bag\nHuman (with principle)\nLLaMA-2-7B:\nTo find the remaining cups of kibble in the bag, we need to calculate the total\namount of kibble that Luna actually received, and then subtract the amount\nthat Mary gave her. The total amount of kibble that Luna received is: 1 cup\nfrom Mary in the morning + 1 cup from Mary in the evening + 1 cup from\nFrank in the afternoon + 2 cups from Frank in the late evening = 5 cups So,\nthe remaining cups of kibble in the bag are: 12 cups - 5 cups = 7 cups\nTherefore, Mary will find 7 cups of kibble remaining in the bag.\nFigure 14: Correctness improvement on small-scale LLaMA-2-7B model after using\nthe introduced principle on prompts.\n16\n\nHuman (without principle):\nWhat is the derivative of x^5 + x^9 - x^3 +1?\nLLaMA-2-13B: To find the derivative of x^5 + x^9 - x^3 + 1, you can use the\npower rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is equal to\nn \\\\* x^(n-1). Starting with x^5 + x^9 - x^3 + 1, you can apply the power rule to\nthe first two terms, which gives you: 5 \\\\* x^(5-1) + 9 \\\\* x^(9-1) You can then\nsimplify the expression by combining like terms: 5 \\\\* x^4 + 9 \\\\* x^8 Finally,\nyou can simplify the expression further by canceling out the common factor of\nx^4: 5 \\\\* 9 \\\\* x^4 = 45 \\\\* x^4\nTherefore, the derivative of x^5 + x^9 - x^3 + 1 is equal to 45 \\\\* x^4.\nHuman (with principle):\nWhat is the derivative of x^5 + x^9 - x^3+1? let's think step by step\nLLaMA-2-13B: find the derivative of the function, we need to take the\nderivative of each term in the function. The derivative of x^5 is 5x^4. The\nderivative of x^9 is 9x^8. The derivative of x^3 is 3x^2. The derivative of 1\nis 1. Therefore, the derivative of the function is: 5x^4 + 9x^8 - 3x^2 + 1 =\n5x^4 + 9x^8 - 3x^2 + 1 - (1) = 5x^4 + 9x^8 - 3x^2 Therefore, the derivative\nof the function x^5 + x^9 - x^3+1 is 5x^4 + 9x^8 - 3x^2.\nFigure 15: Correctness improvement on medium-scale LLaMA-2-13B model after using\nthe introduced principle on prompts.\n17\n\nHuman (without principle):\nLuna, the poodle, is supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day.

To address these variations, we have tested the principles across different scales\nto measure their effectiveness comprehensively.\nDespite our efforts in evaluating these principles on seven distinct language models,\nit is crucial to acknowledge that models with architectures different from those tested\nmight respond in different ways to these principles. Additionally, our assessment of\nimprovement and correctness percentages was based on a limited selection of questions.\nExpanding the question set in future research could yield more generalized findings and\noffer deeper insights into the applicability of each principle. Furthermore, the criteria\nand results may vary across various personnel assessments on the model responses.\n19\n\nReferences\n[1] Simran Arora, Avanika Narayan, Mayee F.

This approach leverages task-specific\ninstructions, known as prompts, to enhance model\nefficacy without modifying the core model param-\neters. Rather than updating the model parameters,\nprompts allow seamless integration of pre-trained\nmodels into downstream tasks by eliciting desired\nmodel behaviors solely based on the given prompt.\nPrompts can be natural language instructions that\nprovide context to guide the model or learned vec-\ntor representations that activate relevant knowledge.\nThis burgeoning field has enabled success across\nvarious applications, from question-answering to\ncommonsense reasoning. However, there remains a\nlack of systematic organization and understanding\nof the diverse prompt engineering methods and tech-\nniques. This survey paper addresses the gap by pro-\nviding a structured overview of recent advancements\nin prompt engineering, categorized by application\narea. For each prompting approach, we provide a\nsummary detailing the prompting methodology, its\napplications, the models involved, and the datasets\nutilized. We also delve into the strengths and limita-\ntions of each approach and include a taxonomy dia-\ngram and table summarizing datasets, models, and\ncritical points of each prompting technique. This\nsystematic analysis enables a better understanding\nof this rapidly developing field and facilitates fu-\nture research by illuminating open challenges and\nopportunities for prompt engineering.\n1 Introduction\nPrompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for\nenhancing the capabilities of pre-trained large language mod-\nels (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). It involves\nstrategically designing task-specific instructions, referred to as\nprompts, to guide model output without altering parameters.\nThe significance of prompt engineering is especially evident\nin its transformative impact on the adaptability of LLMs and\nPrompt Engineering\nInstruction\nUser's Input\nLLM\nPre-trained on\nbillions of\nparameters\nOutput: Response\ngenerated by LLM\nContext\nFigure 1: Visual breakdown of prompt engineering components:\nLLMs trained on extensive data, instruction and context as pivotal\nelements shaping the prompt, and a user input interface.\nVLMs. By offering a mechanism to fine-tune model outputs\nthrough carefully crafted instructions, prompt engineering en-\nables these models to excel across diverse tasks and domains.\nThis adaptability is different from traditional paradigms, where\nmodel retraining or extensive fine-tuning is often required for\ntask-specific performance. This is the transformative promise\nof prompt engineering, pushing the boundaries of AI and\nopening doors to a future brimming with possibilities. In\nan ever-evolving landscape, ongoing research consistently re-\nveals innovative approaches and applications within prompt\nengineering. The significance of prompt engineering is under-\nscored by its capacity to steer model responses, enhancing the\nadaptability and applicability of LLMs across diverse sectors.\nThe landscape of contemporary prompt engineering spans a\nspectrum of techniques, encompassing foundational methods\nlike zero-shot and few-shot prompting to more intricate ap-\nproaches such as \"chain of code\" prompting. The notion of\nprompt engineering was initially investigated and popularized\nin the LLMs \n[\nLiu et al., 2023\n] \n, \n[ \nTonmoy et al., 2024\n]\n, \n[ \nChen\net al., 2023 \n] \nlater extended to VLMs \n[\nWu et al., 2023 \n] \n, \n[ \nBahng\net al., 2022\n] \n. Despite the extensive literature on prompt engi-\nneering within both LLMs and VLMs, a notable gap remains,\nparticularly concerning a systematic overview of application-\ncentric prompt engineering techniques. With recent strides\nin prompt engineering, there is a pressing need for a com-\nprehensive survey that offers a nuanced understanding of ap-\nplications and advancements in contemporary research. This\nsurvey dives deep into the ever-evolving landscape of prompt\nengineering, analyzing over 29 distinct techniques categorized\nby their diverse applications. Employing a systematic review\napproach, we meticulously delve into the intricacies of diverse\narXiv:2402.07927v1 [cs.AI] 5 Feb 2024\n\ncutting-edge prompting methods. Our examination encom-\npasses their applications, the language models utilized, and\nthe datasets subjected to experimentation, providing a detailed\nand nuanced analysis of the evolving landscape of prompt en-\ngineering. Additionally, we discuss the pros and cons of these\ntechniques, offering insights into their comparative efficacy.\nWe unveil a comprehensive taxonomy diagram that sheds light\non how these techniques navigate the vast terrain of LLM\ncapabilities. From language generation and question answer-\ning to code creation and reasoning tasks, prompt engineering\nempowers the LLMs into performing feats we never thought\npossible. By bridging the existing gap in the literature, this\nsurvey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and\npractitioners, offering insights into the latest developments\nand facilitating a deeper understanding of the evolving land-\nscape of prompt engineering. The structure of the paper is\norganized as follows: Section 2 presents the prompt engineer-\ning techniques from both basic to advanced by categorizing\napplication-area and Section 3 provides a conclusion along\nwith considerations for future research endeavors.\n2 Prompt Engineering\nIn this section, we have organized prompt engineering tech-\nniques according to their application areas and provided a\nconcise overview of the evolution of prompting techniques,\nspanning from zero-shot prompting to the latest advancements.\n2.1 New Tasks Without Extensive Training\nZero-Shot Prompting\nZero-shot prompting offers a paradigm shift in leveraging large\nLLMs. This technique \n[\nRadford et al., 2019\n] \nremoves the need\nfor extensive training data, instead relying on carefully crafted\nprompts that guide the model toward novel tasks. Specifically,\nthe model receives a task description in the prompt but lacks la-\nbeled data for training on specific input-output mappings. The\nmodel then leverages its pre-existing knowledge to generate\npredictions based on the given prompt for the new task.\nFew-Shot Prompting\nFew-shot prompting provides models with a few input-output\nexamples to induce an understanding of a given task, unlike\nzero-shot prompting, where no examples are supplied \n[ \nBrown\net al., 2020 \n] \n. Providing even a few high-quality examples\nhas improved model performance on complex tasks compared\nto no demonstration. However, few-shot prompting requires\nadditional tokens to include the examples, which may become\nprohibitive for longer text inputs. Moreover, the selection\nand composition of prompt examples can significantly influ-\nence model behavior, and biases like favoring frequent words\nmay still affect few-shot results. While few-shot prompting\nenhances capabilities for complex tasks, especially among\nlarge pre-trained models like GPT-3, careful prompt engineer-\ning is critical to achieve optimal performance and mitigate\nunintended model biases.\n2.2 Reasoning and Logic\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\nLLMs often stumble in the face of complex reasoning, lim-\niting their potential. Aiming to bridge this gap, \n[\nWei et al.,\n2022 \n] \nintroduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting as a\ntechnique to prompt LLMs in a way that facilitates coherent\nand step-by-step reasoning processes. The primary contribu-\ntion lies in the proposal and exploration of CoT prompting,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in eliciting more structured\nand thoughtful responses from LLMs compared to traditional\nprompts. Through a series of experiments, the authors show-\ncase the distinctive qualities of CoT prompting, emphasizing\nits ability to guide LLMs through a logical reasoning chain.\nThis results in responses that reflect a deeper understanding\nof the given prompts. For example, the prompt would show\nthe reasoning process and final answer for a multi-step math\nword problem and mimic how humans break down problems\ninto logical intermediate steps. The authors achieved state-\nof-the-art performance in math and commonsense reasoning\nbenchmarks by utilizing CoT prompts for PaLM 540B, achiev-\ning an accuracy of 90.2%.\nAutomatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting\nManual creation of high-quality CoT examples is both time-\nconsuming and suboptimal. \n[\nZhang et al., 2022\n] \nintroduced\nAuto-CoT to automatically instruct LLMs with a \"Let’s think\nstep-by-step\" prompt to generate reasoning chains. Recognizing\nthe possibility of errors in individually generated chains, Auto-\nCoT enhances robustness through diverse sampling. It sam-\nples various questions and generates multiple distinct reasoning\nchains for each, forming a final set of demonstrations. This\nautomated diverse sampling minimizes errors and enhances few-\nshot learning, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual\ncreation of reasoning chains. Auto-CoT demonstrated enhanced\nperformance, surpassing the CoT paradigm with average ac-\ncuracy improvements of 1.33% and 1.5% on arithmetic and\nsymbolic reasoning tasks, respectively, employing GPT-3.\nSelf-Consistency\n[\nWang et al., 2022\n] \nintroduced self-consistency, a decoding\nstrategy enhancing reasoning performance compared to greedy\ndecoding in CoT prompting. For complex reasoning tasks with\nmultiple valid paths, self-consistency generates diverse reason-\ning chains by sampling from the language model’s decoder. It\nthen identifies the most consistent final answer by marginalizing\nthese sampled chains. This approach capitalizes on the obser-\nvation that problems requiring thoughtful analysis often entail\ngreater reasoning diversity, leading to a solution. The combina-\ntion of self-consistency and chain-of-thought prompting results\nin significant accuracy improvements across various bench-\nmarks, such as 17.9% on GSM8K, 11.0% on SVAMP, 12.2%\non AQuA, 6.4% on StrategyQA, and 3.9% on ARC-challenge\ncompared to the baseline chain-of-thought prompting.\nLogical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting\nThe ability to perform logical reasoning is critical for LLMs\nto solve complex, multi-step problems across diverse domains.\nExisting methods, like CoT prompting, encourage step-by-step\nreasoning but lack effective verification mechanisms. \n[\nZhao\net al., 2023 \n] \nproposes a Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT)\nprompting, a neurosymbolic framework that leverages princi-\nples from symbolic logic to enhance reasoning in a coherent\nand structured manner. Specifically, LogiCoT applies the con-\ncept of reductio ad absurdum to verify each step of reasoning\n\nPrompt Engineering\nNew Tasks Without Extensive\nTraining §2.1\nZero-shot Prompting \n[Radford\n et al., 2019]\nFew-shot Prompting \n[Brown\n et al., 2020]\nReasoning and Logic §2.2\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting \n[Wei\n et al., 2022]\nAutomatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) \n[Zhang\n et al., 2022]\nSelf-Consistency \n[Wang\n et al., 2022]\nLogical CoT (LogiCoT) Prompting \n[Zhao\n et al., 2023]\nChain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting \n[Hu\n et al., 2023]\nTree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting \n[Yao\n et al., 2023a]\nGraph-of-Thought (GoT) Prompting \n[Yao\n et al., 2023b]\nSystem 2 Attention Prompting \n[Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023]\nThread of Thought (ThoT) Prompting \n[Zhou\n et al., 2023]\nChain of Table Prompting \n[Wang\n et al., 2024]\nReduce Hallucination §2.3\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) \n[Lewis\n et al., 2020]\nReAct Prompting \n[Yao\n et al., 2022]\nChain-of-Verification (CoVe) \n[Dhuliawala\n et al., 2023]\nChain-of-Note (CoN) Prompting \n[Yu\n et al., 2023]\nChain-of-Knowledge (CoK) Prompting \n[Li\n et al., 2023d]\nUser Interaction §2.4 Active-Prompt \n[Diao\n et al., 2023]\nFine-Tuning and Optimization §2.5 Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) \n[Zhou\n et al., 2022]\nKnowledge-Based Reasoning and\nGeneration§2.6\nAutomatic Reasoning\nand Tool-use (ART) \n[Paranjape\n et al., 2023]\nImproving Consistency\nand Coherence §2.7\nContrastive Chain-of-Thought\nPrompting (CCoT) \n[Chia\n et al., 2023]\nManaging Emotions and Tone §2.8 Emotion Prompting \n[Li\n et al., 2023a]\nCode Generation and Execution §2.9\nScratchpad Prompting \n[Nye\n et al., 2021]\nProgram of Thoughts (PoT) Prompting \n[Chen\n et al., 2022]\nStructured Chain-of-Thought\n(SCoT) Prompting \n[Li\n et al., 2023c]\nChain of Code (CoC) Prompting \n[Li\n et al., 2023b]\nOptimization and Efficiency §2.10 Optimization by Prompting \n[Yang\n et al., 2023]\nUnderstanding User Intent §2.11 Rephrase and Respond (RaR) Prompting \n[Deng\n et al., 2023]\nMetacognition and Self-Reflection §2.12 Take a Step Back Prompting \n[Zheng\n et al., 2023]\nFigure 2: Taxonomy of prompt engineering techniques in LLMs, organized around application domains, providing a nuanced framework for\ncustomizing prompts across diverse contexts.\ngenerated by the model and provide targeted feedback to revise\nincorrect steps. LogiCoT can reduce logical errors and hallu-\ncinations through a think-verify-revise loop. Experimenting\nwith Vicuna-33b and GPT-4, the findings underscore Logi-\nCoT’s notable enhancement of reasoning abilities, exhibiting\nimprovements of 0.16% and 1.42% on the GSM8K dataset\nand 3.15% and 2.75% on the AQuA dataset compared to CoT,\nrespectively.\nChain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting\nLLMs often struggle with tasks involving complex spatial re-\nlationships due to their reliance on natural language, which is\nsusceptible to ambiguity and biases. To overcome this limita-\ntion, \n[\nHu et al., 2023\n] \nintroduced CoS, employing condensed\nsymbols instead of natural language. CoS provides distinct\nadvantages: clear and concise prompts, heightened spatial rea-\nsoning for LLMs, and improved human interpretability. CoS\nsuffers from challenges such as scalability, generalizability, in-\n\ntegration with other techniques, and interpretability of LLM\nreasoning based on symbols. Notably, the implementation of\nCoS significantly elevates ChatGPT’s performance, boosting\naccuracy from 31.8% to an impressive 92.6% on Brick World\ntasks. Moreover, CoS achieves up to a 65.8% reduction in\nprompt tokens, streamlining the process while maintaining high\naccuracy.\nTree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting\n[\nYao et al., 2023a\n] \nand \n[\nLong, 2023\n] \nproposed the Tree-of-\nThoughts (ToT) framework to enhance prompting capabilities\nfor complex tasks requiring exploration and look-ahead reason-\ning. ToT extends CoT prompting by managing a tree structure\nof intermediate reasoning steps, known as \"thoughts\". Each\nthought represents a coherent language sequence moving to-\nward the final solution. This structure allows language models\nto deliberately reason by assessing the progress generated by\nthoughts in solving the problem. ToT integrates the model’s abil-\nities to produce and evaluate thoughts with search algorithms\nlike breadth-first or depth-first search. This enables system-\natic exploration among reasoning chains, with a look-ahead to\nexpand promising directions and to backtrack when solutions\nare incorrect. ToT excelled in the Game of 24 tasks, achieving\na 74% success rate compared to CoT’s 4%. Additionally, in\nword-level tasks, ToT outperformed CoT with a 60% success\nrate versus 16%.\nGraph-of-Thoughts (GoT) Prompting\nThe inherent non-linear nature of human thought processes chal-\nlenges the conventional sequential approach of CoT prompt-\ning. \n[\nYao et al., 2023b\n] \nintroduced the \"Graph of Thoughts\"\nprompting, a graph-based framework advancing traditional se-\nquential methods to better align with the non-linear character-\nistics of human thinking. This framework permits dynamic\ninterplay, backtracking, and evaluation of ideas, allowing the\naggregation and combination of thoughts from various branches,\ndeparting from the linear structure of the tree of thoughts. The\nkey contributions encompass modeling the reasoning process as\na directed graph, offering a modular architecture with diverse\ntransformation operations. The framework is presented as a ver-\nsatile and dynamic approach to language model prompting, cap-\nturing the intricacies of human thought processes and enhancing\nmodel capabilities. The GoT reasoning model demonstrates\nsubstantial gains over the CoT baseline, improving accuracy\nby 3.41% with T5-base and 5.08% with T5-large on GSM8K.\nIt also boosts accuracy over the state-of-the-art Multimodal-\nCoT by 6.63% using T5-base and 1.09% with T5-large on\nScienceQA.\nSystem 2 Attention (S2A) Prompting\nThe soft attention mechanism in Transformer-based LLMs is\nprone to incorporating irrelevant context information, impact-\ning token generation adversely. To address this, \n[\nWeston and\nSukhbaatar, 2023\n] \nproposed System 2 Attention (S2A), utilizing\nthe reasoning abilities of LLMs to selectively attend to relevant\nportions by regenerating the input context. S2A employs a\ntwo-step process to enhance attention and response quality by\nemploying context regeneration and response generation with\nrefined context. The effectiveness of S2A is evaluated across\nvarious tasks, including factual QA, long-form generation, and\nmath word problems. In factual QA, S2A attains an accuracy of\n80.3%, demonstrating a substantial enhancement in factuality.\nIn long-form generation, it improves objectivity and receives a\nscore of 3.82 out of 5.\nThread of Thought (ThoT) Prompting\n[\nZhou et al., 2023\n] \npresented Thread of Thought (ThoT), a\nprompting technique designed to enhance the reasoning abil-\nities of LLMs within chaotic contexts. ThoT, inspired by hu-\nman cognition, systematically examines extensive contexts into\nmanageable segments for incremental analysis, employing a\ntwo-phase approach where the LLM first summarizes and ex-\namines each segment before refining the information for a final\nresponse. ThoT’s flexibility shines as a versatile \"plug-and-\nplay\" module, enhancing reasoning across different models and\nprompting methods. Evaluations on question answering and\nconversation datasets reveal substantial performance improve-\nments of 47.20% and 17.8%, respectively, especially in chaotic\ncontexts.\nChain-of-Table Prompting\nApproaches like CoT, PoT, and ToT represent reasoning steps\nthrough free-form text or code, which face challenges when\ndealing with intricate table scenarios. The study by \n[\nWang et\nal., 2024\n] \nintroduced a pioneering prompting technique named\nChain-of-Table. This method uses step-by-step tabular reason-\ning by dynamically generating and executing common SQL/-\nDataFrame operations on tables. The iterative nature of this\nprocess enhances intermediate results, empowering LLMs to\nmake predictions through logically visualized reasoning chains.\nSignificantly, Chain-of-Table consistently improves the perfor-\nmance of two benchmark tabular datasets by 8.69% on TabFact\nand 6.72% on WikiTQ, respectively.\n2.3 Reduce Hallucination\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nLLMs have revolutionized text generation, yet their reliance\non limited, static training data hinders accurate responses,\nespecially in tasks demanding external knowledge. Traditional\nprompting falls short, requiring expensive retraining. Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) \n[ \nLewis et al., 2020\n] \nemerges\nas a novel solution, seamlessly weaving information retrieval\ninto the prompting process. RAG analyzes user input, crafts\na targeted query, and scours a pre-built knowledge base for\nrelevant resources. Retrieved snippets are incorporated into the\noriginal prompt, enriching it with contextual background. The\naugmented prompt empowers the LLM to generate creative,\nfactually accurate responses. RAG’s agility overcomes static\nlimitations, making it a game-changer for tasks requiring up-\nto-date knowledge. RAG outperformed seq2seq models and\ntask-specific architectures on ODQA benchmarks, achieving\nexact match scores, reaching up to 56.8% on TriviaQA and\n44.5% on Natural Questions.\nReAct Prompting\nUnlike previous studies that treated reasoning and action sep-\narately, ReAct \n[\nYao et al., 2022\n] \nenables LLMs to generate\nreasoning traces and task-specific actions concurrently. This\ninterleaved process enhances synergy between reasoning and\n\naction, facilitating the model in inducing, tracking, and updat-\ning action plans while handling exceptions. ReAct is applied\nto diverse language and decision-making tasks, showcasing\nits effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, in\nquestion answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever),\nReAct addresses hallucination and error propagation issues by\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, producing more inter-\npretable task-solving trajectories. Additionally, in interactive\ndecision-making benchmarks like ALFWorld and WebShop,\nReAct surpasses both imitation and reinforcement learning ap-\nproaches, achieving notable success rates of 34% and 10%,\nrespectively, with minimal in-context examples.\nChain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting\nTo address hallucinations in LLMs, \n[\nDhuliawala et al., 2023\n]\nproposed Chain-of-Verification (CoVe), which involves a sys-\ntematic four-step process including the model generate baseline\nresponses, plan verification questions to check its work, answer\nthe questions independently, and produce a revised response\nincorporating the verification. By verifying its work through\nthis deliberate multi-step approach, the LLM enhances logi-\ncal reasoning abilities and reduces errors even with contradic-\ntory information. CoVe emulates human verification to bolster\nthe coherence and precision of LLM output. Experiments on\nlist questions, QA, and long-form generation demonstrate that\nCoVe decreases hallucinations while maintaining facts. Fo-\ncused verification questions help models identify and correct\ntheir inaccuracies.\nChain-of-Note (CoN) Prompting\nRetrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) enhance\nlarge language models by incorporating external knowledge\nto reduce factual hallucination. However, the reliability of\nretrieved information is not guaranteed, leading to potentially\nmisguided responses. Standard RALMs struggle to assess their\nknowledge adequacy and often fail to respond with \"unknown\"\nwhen lacking information. To address these challenges, \n[\nYu\net al., 2023\n] \nintroduced a novel approach to improve RALMs\nrobustness by handling noisy, irrelevant documents and ac-\ncurately addressing unknown scenarios. CoN systematically\nevaluates document relevance, emphasizing critical and re-\nliable information to filter out irrelevant content, resulting\nin more precise and contextually relevant responses. Test-\ning across diverse open-domain question-answering datasets\ndemonstrated notable improvements, including a +7.9 average\nboost in exact match scores for noisy retrieved documents and\na +10.5 enhancement in rejection rates for questions beyond\npre-training knowledge.\nChain-of-Knowledge (CoK) Prompting\nTraditional prompting techniques for LLMs have proven power-\nful in tackling basic tasks. However, their efficacy diminishes\ndue to complex reasoning challenges, often resulting in unre-\nliable outputs plagued by factual hallucinations and opaque\nthought processes. This limitation arises from their reliance\non fixed knowledge sources, ineffective structured query gen-\neration, and lack of progressive correction that fails to guide\nthe LLM adequately. Motivated by human problem-solving,\nCoK \n[\nLi et al., 2023d\n] \nsystematically breaks down intricate\ntasks into well-coordinated steps. The process initiates with a\ncomprehensive reasoning preparation stage, where the context\nis established, and the problem is framed. Subsequently, it en-\ngages in a dynamic knowledge adaptation phase, meticulously\ngathering evidence from various sources, such as its internal\nknowledge base, external databases, and the given prompt.\n2.4 User Interface\nActive Prompting\n[\nDiao et al., 2023\n] \nintroduced Active-Prompting as a solution\nto the challenge of adapting LLMs to diverse reasoning tasks.\nThey address the issue by proposing Active-Prompt to enhance\nLLMs’ performance on complex question-and-answer tasks\nthrough task-specific example prompts with chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning. Unlike existing CoT methods that rely on\nfixed sets of human-annotated exemplars, Active-Prompt intro-\nduces a mechanism for determining the most impactful ques-\ntions for annotation. Drawing inspiration from uncertainty-\nbased active learning, the method utilizes various metrics to\ncharacterize uncertainty and selects the most uncertain ques-\ntions for annotation. Active-Prompting exhibits superior per-\nformance, outperforming self-consistency by an average of\n7.0% and 1.8% across eight complex reasoning tasks in text-\ndavinci-002 and code-davinci-002, respectively, showcasing\nstate-of-the-art results.\n2.5 Fine-Tuning and Optimization\nAutomatic Prompt Engineer (APE)\nWhile crafting effective prompts for LLMs has traditionally\nbeen a laborious task for expert annotators, \n[\nZhou et al.,\n2022 \n] \nintroduced Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) as an\ninnovative approach to automatic instruction generation and\nselection for LLMs. APE sheds the limitations of static, hand-\ndesigned prompts by dynamically generating and selecting\nthe most impactful prompts for specific tasks. This ingenious\nmethod analyzes user input, crafts candidate instructions, and\nthen leverages reinforcement learning to choose the optimal\nprompt, adapting it on the fly to different contexts. Extensive\ntests on the diverse BIG-Bench suite and the CoT reason-\ning task revealed APE’s prowess, exceeding human-authored\nprompts in most cases (19 out of 24 tasks) and significantly\nboosting LLMs reasoning abilities. This breakthrough in auto-\nmatic prompt engineering paves the way for LLMs to tackle a\nwider range of tasks with greater efficiency and adaptability,\nunlocking their full potential across diverse applications.\n2.6 Knowledge-Based Reasoning and Generation\nAutomatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)\nThe limited reasoning abilities and lack of external tool utiliza-\ntion hinder the potential of LLMs in complex tasks. \n[ \nParanjape\net al., 2023\n] \nintroduced Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use\n(ART) to tackle this critical barrier that empowers LLMs to\nreason through multi-step processes and seamlessly integrate\nexternal expertise. ART bridges the reasoning gap, enabling\nLLMs to tackle complex problems and expand beyond simple\ntext generation. By integrating external tools for specialized\nknowledge and computations, ART unlocks unprecedented\nversatility and informs LLM outputs with real-world relevance.\nThis allows LLMs to contribute to diverse fields like scientific\nresearch, data analysis, and even decision-making support.\n\nMoving beyond traditional prompting techniques, ART au-\ntomates reasoning steps through structured programs, elimi-\nnating the need for laborious hand-crafting. Its dynamic tool\nintegration ensures smooth collaboration, pausing generation\nto incorporate external tool outputs and seamlessly resuming\nthe flow. Empirical evidence on challenging benchmarks (Big-\nBench and MMLU) demonstrates ART’s effectiveness, sur-\npassing traditional prompting and even matching hand-crafted\ndemonstrations in some cases.\n2.7 Improving Consistency and Coherence\nContrastive Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) Prompting\nTraditional CoT prompting for LLMs often misses a crucial\nelement: learning from mistakes. That is where Contrastive\nChain-of-Thought Prompting (CCoT) \n[ \nChia et al., 2023\n] \ndives\nin, providing both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations\nalongside original prompts. Imagine exploring a map with the\nright path and the wrong turns to avoid – that is the advantage\nof contrastive CoT! This dual-perspective approach, tested on\nreasoning benchmarks like SQuAD and COPA, pushes LLMs\nto step-by-step reasoning, leading to 4-16% improvements in\nstrategic and mathematical reasoning evaluations compared\nto traditional CoT, further improved by approximately 5%\nwhen integrated with self-consistency techniques. However,\nquestions remain about this technique, such as the automated\ngeneration of contrasting demonstrations for diverse problems\nand its applicability to other NLP tasks beyond reasoning.\n2.8 Managing Emotions and Tone\nEmotion Prompting\nWhile LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities on various\ntasks, their ability to comprehend psychological and emotional\ncues remains uncertain. The study by \n[\nLi et al., 2023a \n] \nad-\ndressed the uncertainty surrounding LLMs’ ability to compre-\nhend emotional cues by introducing EmotionPrompt. Drawing\ninspiration from psychological research on language’s impact\non human performance, they append 11 emotional stimulus\nsentences to prompts to enhance LLM emotional intelligence.\nExperimental results demonstrate seamless integration of these\nstimuli, significantly improving LLM performance across var-\nious tasks. EmotionPrompt demonstrates an 8.00% relative\nimprovement in instruction induction and an impressive 115%\nboost in BIG-Bench tasks, underscoring its efficacy in aug-\nmenting LLM capabilities in processing affective signals. An\nevaluation involving 106 participants reveals an average im-\nprovement of 10.9% in performance, truthfulness, and respon-\nsibility metrics for generative tasks when employing Emotion-\nPrompt compared to standard prompts.\n2.9 Code Generation and Execution\nScratchpad Prompting\nDespite the prowess of Transformer-based language models in\ngenerating code for basic programming tasks, they encounter\nchallenges in complex, multi-step algorithmic calculations re-\nquiring precise reasoning. Addressing this, \n[\nNye et al., 2021\n]\nintroduce a novel approach, centered on task design rather than\nmodel modification, introduce a ‘scratchpad’ concept. The pro-\nposal enables the model to generate an arbitrary sequence of in-\ntermediate tokens before providing the final answer. Scratchpad\nPrompting technique outperforms (Mostly Basic Python Pro-\ngramming) MBPP-aug with a 46.8% success rate. Combining\nCodeNet and single-line datasets yields the highest performance,\nachieving 26.6% correct final outputs and 24.6% perfect traces.\nScratchpad prompting technique faces limitations, including a\nfixed context window size of 512 tokens and a dependency on\nsupervised learning for scratchpad utilization.\nProgram of Thoughts (PoT) Prompting\nLanguage models are suboptimal for solving mathematical ex-\npressions due to their proneness to arithmetic errors, incapa-\nbility in handling complex equations, and inefficiency in ex-\npressing extensive iterations. To enhance numerical reasoning\nin language models, \n[\nChen et al., 2022\n] \npresents Program-\nof-Thoughts (PoT) prompting, advocating the use of external\nlanguage interpreters for computation steps. PoT enables mod-\nels like Codex to express reasoning through executable Python\nprograms, resulting in an average performance improvement of\napproximately 12% compared to CoT prompting on datasets\ninvolving mathematical word problems and financial questions.\nStructured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting\nLLMs have exhibited impressive proficiency in code gener-\nation. The widely used CoT prompting involves producing\nintermediate natural language reasoning steps before generat-\ning code. Despite its efficacy in natural language generation,\nCoT prompting demonstrates lower accuracy when applied\nto code generation tasks. \n[ \nLi et al., 2023c \n] \nintroduce Struc-\ntured Chain-of-Thought (SCoTs) as an innovative prompting\ntechnique tailored specifically for code generation. By in-\ncorporating program structures (sequence, branch, and loop\nstructures) into reasoning steps, SCoT prompting enhances\nLLMs’ performance in generating structured source code. This\napproach explicitly guides LLMs to consider requirements\nfrom the source code perspective, improving their overall ef-\nfectiveness in code generation compared to CoT prompting.\nThe authors validated the effectiveness of SCoT on ChatGPT\nand Codex across three benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, and\nMBCPP) and demonstrated a superior performance over the\nCoT prompting by up to 13.79%.\nChain-of-Code (CoC) Prompting\nWhile CoT prompting has proven very effective for enhancing\nLanguage models (LMs) semantic reasoning skills, it strug-\ngles to handle questions requiring numeric or symbolic reason-\ning. \n[ \nLi et al., 2023b\n] \nintroduce Chain-of-Code (CoC) as an\nextension to improve LM reasoning by leveraging codewriting\nfor both logic and semantic tasks. CoC encourages LMs to\nformat semantic sub-tasks as flexible pseudocode, allowing\nan interpreter to catch undefined behaviors and simulate them\nwith an \"LMulator.\" Experiments demonstrate CoC’s superior-\nity over Chain of Thought and other baselines, achieving an\n84% accuracy on BIG-Bench Hard, a 12% gain. CoC proves\neffective with both large and small models, expanding LMs’\nability to correctly answer reasoning questions by incorporat-\ning a \"think in code\" approach.\n2.10 Optimization and Efficiency\nOptimization by Prompting (OPRO)\nIn various domains, optimization is a fundamental process\noften involving iterative techniques. \n[\nYang et al., 2023\n] \nintro-\n\nTable 1: Summary of prevalent prompting techniques of LLMs based on the following factors: application, prompt acquisition, prompt turn,\nlanguage model, dataset, and metrics.\nApplication \nPrompting\nTechnique\nComparison Scope\nPrompt Acquisition Prompt Turn Language Model(s) Dataset Metric(s)\nNew Tasks Without\nTraining Data \nZero-shot Manual Single GPT-2 Arithmetic,Symbolic Accuracy, ROUGE Score\nFew-shot Manual Single GPT-3 NaturalQS, WebQS, TriviaQA Accuracy\nCoT Manual Multi PaLM 540B GSM8K Accuracy\nLogiCoT Manual Multi Vicuna-33b, GPT-4 GSM8K, AQuA, SocialQA Accuracy\nCoS Manual Multi gpt-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 SPARTUN Accuracy, Precision, Recall\nAuto-CoT LM Generated Multi GPT-3 Arithmetic, Symbolic Accuracy\nSelf-Consistency Manual Single PaLM 540B Arithmetic, Commonsense Accuracy\nReasoning and Logic \nToT Retrieval Based Multi GPT-4 Game of 24, Creative Writing Success Rate\nGoT Retrieval Based Multi T5-large GSM8K, ScienceQA ROUGE Score\nS2A Manual Single Llama 2-70B QA,GSM8K Accuracy\nThoT Hybrid Multi gpt-3.5-turbo, Llama 2-70b-chat PopQA, EntityQ, MTCR Exact Match (EM) Score\nChain of Table Manual Multi GPT 3.5, LLaMA 2 TabFact, WikiTQ BLEU, ROUGE Score\nCoVe Retrieval Based Multi Llama 65B Wikidata, QUEST, MultiSpanQA Precision, F1\nReAct Retrieval Based Multi PaLM-540B, GPT-3 HotpotQA, FEVER Exact Match (EM), Accuracy\nReduce Hallucination \nRAG Retrieval Based Single RAG-Token, RAG-Seq.

Unlike traditional meth-\nods, OPRO utilizes natural language prompts to iteratively\ngenerate solutions based on the problem description, enabling\nquick adaptation to different tasks and customization of the\noptimization process. The potential of LLMs for optimization\nis demonstrated through case studies on classic problems like\nlinear regression and the traveling salesman problem. Addi-\ntionally, it explores the optimization of prompts to maximize\naccuracy in natural language processing tasks, highlighting\nthe sensitivity of LLMs. The experiments show that optimiz-\ning prompts for accuracy on a small training set effectively\ntranslates to high performance on the test set. OPRO leads\nto a significant performance boost, with the most effective\nprompts optimized by OPRO outperforming human-designed\nprompts by up to 8% on the GSM8K dataset and up to 50%\non challenging tasks in Big-Bench.\n2.11 Understanding User Intent\nRephrase and Respond (RaR) Prompting\nThe study by \n[\nDeng et al., 2023\n] \nbrings attention to an often-\nneglected dimension in exploring LLMs: the disparity between\nhuman thought frames and those of LLMs and introduces\nRephrase and Respond (RaR). RaR allows LLMs to rephrase\nand expand questions in a single prompt, demonstrating im-\nproved comprehension and response accuracy. The two-step\nRaR variant, incorporating rephrasing and response LLMs,\nachieves substantial performance enhancements across vari-\nous tasks. The study highlights that in contrast to casually\nposed human queries, the rephrased questions contribute to en-\nhanced semantic clarity and the resolution of inherent ambiguity.\nThese findings offer valuable insights for understanding and\nenhancing the efficacy of LLMs across various applications.\n2.12 Metacognition and Self-Reflection\nTake a Step Back Prompting\nAddressing the persistent challenge of complex multi-step rea-\nsoning, \n[\nZheng et al., 2023\n] \nintroduced the Step-Back prompt-\ning technique, tailored explicitly for advanced language models\nlike PaLM-2L. This innovative approach empowers models to\nengage in abstraction, extracting high-level concepts and fun-\ndamental principles from specific instances. The Step-Back\nprompting method involves a two-step procedure, integrating\nAbstraction and Reasoning. Through extensive experiments, ap-\nplying Step-Back Prompting to PaLM-2L in diverse reasoning-\nintensive tasks such as STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop\nReasoning, the results demonstrate a substantial enhancement\nin reasoning capabilities. Noteworthy performance boosts are\nobserved, with improvements in tasks like MMLU Physics and\nChemistry by 7%, TimeQA by 27%, and MuSiQue by 7%.\n3 Conclusion\nIn the domain of artificial intelligence, prompt engineering has\nbecome a transformative force, unlocking the vast potential\nof LLMs. This survey paper aims to serve as a foundational\n\nresource that systematically categorizes 29 distinct prompt engi-\nneering techniques based on their targeted functionalities, inspir-\ning further research and empowering innovators in the evolving\nlandscape of prompt engineering. The analysis spans applica-\ntions, models, and datasets, shedding light on the strengths and\nlimitations of each approach. Furthermore, we have added a\ndiagram and a table to highlight the important points. Despite\nthe remarkable successes, challenges persist, including biases,\nfactual inaccuracies, and interpretability gaps, necessitating\nfurther investigation and mitigation strategies. The future of\nprompt engineering holds immense potential, with emerging\ntrends like meta-learning and hybrid prompting architectures\npromising amplified capabilities. However, ethical considera-\ntions are paramount, emphasizing responsible development and\ndeployment to ensure positive integration into our lives.\nReferences\n[Bahng\n et al., 2022]\n \nHyojin Bahng, Ali Jahanian, Swami\nSankaranarayanan, and Phillip Isola.

Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query,\nspecifying a style,\n[5] \nproviding relevant context\n[7] \nor assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native\nFrench speaker\".\n[8] \nA prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the\nmodel to complete \"maison → house, chat → cat, chien →\" (the expected response being dog),\n[9] \nan\napproach called few-shot learning.\n[10]\nWhen communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a\ndesired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\"\n[11] \nor \"Lo-fi slow BPM\nelectro chill with organic samples\".\n[12] \nPrompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing,\nemphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style,\n[1] \nlayout, lighting,\n[13] \nand\naesthetic.\nPrompt engineering is enabled by in-context learning, defined as a model's ability to temporarily learn\nfrom prompts. The ability for in-context learning is an emergent ability\n[14] \nof large language models. In-\ncontext learning itself is an emergent property of model scale, meaning breaks\n[15] \nin downstream scaling\nlaws occur such that its efficacy increases at a different rate in larger models than in smaller\nmodels.\n[16][17]\nIn contrast to training and fine-tuning for each specific task, which are not temporary, what has been\nlearnt during in-context learning is of a temporary nature. It does not carry the temporary contexts or\nbiases, except the ones already present in the (pre)training dataset, from one conversation to the other.\n[18]\nThis result of \"mesa-optimization\"\n[19][20] \nwithin transformer layers, is a form of meta-learning or\n\"learning to learn\".\n[21]\nIn 2018, researchers first proposed that all previously separate tasks in NLP could be cast as a question\nanswering problem over a context. In addition, they trained a first single, joint, multi-task model that\nwould answer any task-related question like \"What is the sentiment\" or \"Translate this sentence to\nGerman\" or \"Who is the president?\"\n[22]\nIn 2021, researchers fine-tuned one generatively pretrained model (T0) on performing 12 NLP tasks\n(using 62 datasets, as each task can have multiple datasets). The model showed good performance on new\ntasks, surpassing models trained directly on just performing one task (without pretraining). To solve a\nIn-context learning\nHistory\n\ntask, T0 is given the task in a structured prompt, for example If {{premise}} is true, is it\nalso true that {{hypothesis}}? ||| {{entailed}}. is the prompt used for making T0\nsolve entailment.\n[23]\nA repository for prompts reported that over 2,000 public prompts for around 170 datasets were available\nin February 2022.\n[24]\nIn 2022 the chain-of-thought prompting technique was proposed by Google researchers.\n[17][25]\nIn 2023 several text-to-text and text-to-image prompt databases were publicly available.\n[26][27]\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve a\nproblem as a series of intermediate steps\n[28] \nbefore giving a final answer. Chain-of-thought prompting\nimproves reasoning ability by inducing the model to answer a multi-step problem with steps of reasoning\nthat mimic a train of thought.\n[29][17][30] \nIt allows large language models to overcome difficulties with\nsome reasoning tasks that require logical thinking and multiple steps to solve, such as arithmetic or\ncommonsense reasoning questions.\n[31][32][33]\nFor example, given the question \"Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and\nbought 6 more, how many apples do they have?\", a CoT prompt might induce the LLM to answer \"A:\nThe cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought\n6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9.\"\n[17]\nAs originally proposed,\n[17] \neach CoT prompt included a few Q&A examples. This made it a few-shot\nprompting technique. However, simply appending the words \"Let's think step-by-step\",\n[34] \nhas also\nproven effective, which makes CoT a zero-shot prompting technique. This allows for better scaling as a\nuser no longer needs to formulate many specific CoT Q&A examples.\n[35]\nWhen applied to PaLM, a 540B parameter language model, CoT prompting significantly aided the model,\nallowing it to perform comparably with task-specific fine-tuned models on several tasks, achieving state\nof the art results at the time on the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark.\n[17] \nIt is possible to fine-\ntune models on CoT reasoning datasets to enhance this capability further and stimulate better\ninterpretability.\n[36][37]\nExample:\n[34]\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.\nChain-of-thought prompting is just one of many prompt-engineering techniques. Various other techniques\nhave been proposed. At least 29 distinct techniques have been published.\n[38]\nText-to-text\nChain-of-thought\nOther techniques\n\nChain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting\nChain-of-Symbol prompting in conjunction with CoT prompting assists LLMs with its difficulty of\nspatial reasoning in text. In other words, using arbitrary symbols such as ' / ' assist the LLM to interpret\nspacing in text. This assists in reasoning and increases the performance of the LLM.\n[39]\nExample:\n[39]\nInput:\nThere are a set of bricks. The yellow brick C is on top of the brick E. The yellow brick D is on top\nof the brick A. The yellow brick E is on top of the brick D. The white brick A is on top of the brick\nB. For the brick B, the color is white. Now we have to get a specific brick. The bricks must now be\ngrabbed from top to bottom, and if the lower brick is to be grabbed, the upper brick must be removed\nfirst. How to get brick D?\nB/A/D/E/C\nC/E\nE/D\nD\nOutput:\nSo we get the result as C, E, D.\nGenerated knowledge prompting\n[40] \nfirst prompts the model to generate relevant facts for completing the\nprompt, then proceed to complete the prompt. The completion quality is usually higher, as the model can\nbe conditioned on relevant facts.\nExample:\n[40]\nGenerate some knowledge about the concepts in the input.\nInput: {question}\nKnowledge:\nLeast-to-most prompting\n[41] \nprompts a model to first list the sub-problems to a problem, then solve them\nin sequence, such that later sub-problems can be solved with the help of answers to previous sub-\nproblems.\nExample:\n[41]\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's break down this problem:\n1.\nGenerated knowledge prompting\nLeast-to-most prompting\nSelf-consistency decoding\n\nSelf-consistency decoding\n[42] \nperforms several chain-of-thought rollouts, then selects the most commonly\nreached conclusion out of all the rollouts. If the rollouts disagree by a lot, a human can be queried for the\ncorrect chain of thought.\n[43]\nComplexity-based prompting\n[44] \nperforms several CoT rollouts, then select the rollouts with the longest\nchains of thought, then select the most commonly reached conclusion out of those.\nSelf-refine\n[45] \nprompts the LLM to solve the problem, then prompts the LLM to critique its solution, then\nprompts the LLM to solve the problem again in view of the problem, solution, and critique. This process\nis repeated until stopped, either by running out of tokens, time, or by the LLM outputting a \"stop\" token.\nExample critique:\n[45]\nI have some code. Give one suggestion to improve readability. Don't fix the code, just give a\nsuggestion.\nCode: {code}\nSuggestion:\nExample refinement:\nCode: {code}\nLet's use this suggestion to improve the code.\nSuggestion: {suggestion}\nNew Code:\nTree-of-thought prompting\n[46] \ngeneralizes chain-of-thought by prompting the model to generate one or\nmore \"possible next steps\", and then running the model on each of the possible next steps by breadth-\nfirst, beam, or some other method of tree search.\n[47]\nMaieutic prompting is similar to tree-of-thought. The model is prompted to answer a question with an\nexplanation. The model is then prompted to explain parts of the explanation, and so on. Inconsistent\nexplanation trees are pruned or discarded. This improves performance on complex commonsense\nreasoning.\n[48]\nExample:\n[48]\nQ: {question}\nA: True, because\nComplexity-based prompting\nSelf-refine\nTree-of-thought\nMaieutic prompting\n\nTwo-phase process of document\nretrieval using dense embeddings\nand Large Language Model (LLM)\nfor answer formulation\nQ: {question}\nA: False, because\nDirectional-stimulus prompting\n[49] \nincludes a hint or cue, such as desired keywords, to guide a language\nmodel toward the desired output.\nExample:\n[49]\nArticle: {article}\nKeywords:\nArticle: {article}\nQ: Write a short summary of the article in 2-4 sentences that accurately incorporates the provided\nkeywords.\nKeywords: {keywords}\nA:\nBy default, the output of language models may not contain estimates of uncertainty. The model may\noutput text that appears confident, though the underlying token predictions have low likelihood scores.\nLarge language models like GPT-4 can have accurately calibrated likelihood scores in their token\npredictions,\n[50] \nand so the model output uncertainty can be directly estimated by reading out the token\nprediction likelihood scores.\nBut if one cannot access such scores (such as when one is accessing the model through a restrictive API),\nuncertainty can still be estimated and incorporated into the model output. One simple method is to prompt\nthe model to use words to estimate uncertainty.\n[51] \nAnother is to prompt the model to refuse to answer in\na standardized way if the input does not satisfy conditions.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a two-phase process\ninvolving document retrieval and answer formulation by a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM). The initial phase utilizes dense\nembeddings to retrieve documents. This retrieval can be based on\na variety of database formats depending on the use case, such as a\nvector database, summary index, tree index, or keyword table\nindex.\n[52]\nIn response to a query, a document retriever selects the most\nrelevant documents. This relevance is typically determined by first\nencoding both the query and the documents into vectors, then identifying documents whose vectors are\nclosest in Euclidean distance to the query vector. Following document retrieval, the LLM generates an\nDirectional-stimulus prompting\nPrompting to disclose uncertainty\nAutomatic prompt generation\nRetrieval-augmented generation\n\nGraphRAG with a knowledge graph\ncombining access patterns for\nunstructured, structured and mixed\ndata.\noutput that incorporates information from both the query and the retrieved documents.\n[53] \nThis method is\nparticularly beneficial for handling proprietary or dynamic information that was not included in the initial\ntraining or fine-tuning phases of the model. RAG is also notable for its use of \"few-shot\" learning, where\nthe model uses a small number of examples, often automatically retrieved from a database, to inform its\noutputs.\nGraphRAG,\n[54] \ncoined by Microsoft Research, extends RAG such\nthat instead of relying solely on vector similarity (as in most RAG\napproaches), GraphRAG uses the LLM-generated knowledge\ngraph. This graph allows the model to connect disparate pieces of\ninformation, synthesize insights, and holistically understand\nsummarized semantic concepts over large data collections.\nResearchers have demonstrated GraphRAG's effectiveness using\ndatasets like the Violent Incident Information from News Articles\n(VIINA).\n[55] \nBy combining LLM-generated knowledge graphs\nwith graph machine learning, GraphRAG substantially improves\nboth the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers for global sensemaking questions.\nEarlier work showed the effectiveness of using a knowledge graph for question answering using text-to-\nquery generation.\n[56] \nThese techniques can be combined to perform search across both unstructured and\nstructured data, providing expanded context and improved ranking.\nLarge language models (LLM) themselves can be used to compose prompts for large language\nmodels.\n[57][58][59][60]\nThe automatic prompt engineer algorithm uses one LLM to beam search over prompts for another\nLLM:\n[61]\nThere are two LLMs. One is the target LLM, and another is the prompting LLM.\nPrompting LLM is presented with example input-output pairs, and asked to generate\ninstructions that could have caused a model following the instructions to generate the\noutputs, given the inputs.\nEach of the generated instructions is used to prompt the target LLM, followed by each of the\ninputs. The log-probabilities of the outputs are computed and added. This is the score of the\ninstruction.\nThe highest-scored instructions are given to the prompting LLM for further variations.\nRepeat until some stopping criteria is reached, then output the highest-scored instructions.\nGraph retrieval-augmented generation\nUsing language models to generate prompts\n\nCoT examples can be generated by LLM themselves. In \"auto-CoT\",\n[62] \na library of questions are\nconverted to vectors by a model such as BERT. The question vectors are clustered. Questions nearest to\nthe centroids of each cluster are selected. An LLM does zero-shot CoT on each question. The resulting\nCoT examples are added to the dataset. When prompted with a new question, CoT examples to the\nnearest questions can be retrieved and added to the prompt.\nIn 2022, text-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney were released to the\npublic.\n[63] \nThese models take text prompts as input and use them to generate AI art images. Text-to-image\nmodels typically do not understand grammar and sentence structure in the same way as large language\nmodels,\n[64] \nand require a different set of prompting techniques.\nA text-to-image prompt commonly includes a description of the subject of the art (such as bright orange\npoppies), the desired medium (such as digital painting or photography), style (such as hyperrealistic or\npop-art), lighting (such as rim lighting or crepuscular rays), color and texture.\n[65]\nThe Midjourney documentation encourages short, descriptive prompts: instead of \"Show me a picture of\nlots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated\nstyle with colored pencils\", an effective prompt might be \"Bright orange California poppies drawn with\ncolored pencils\".\n[64]\nWord order affects the output of a text-to-image prompt. Words closer to the start of a prompt may be\nemphasized more heavily.\n[1]\nSome text-to-image models are capable of imitating the style of particular artists by name. For example,\nthe phrase in the style of Greg Rutkowski has been used in Stable Diffusion and Midjourney prompts to\ngenerate images in the distinctive style of Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski.\n[66]\nText-to-image models do not natively understand negation. The prompt \"a party with no cake\" is likely to\nproduce an image including a cake.\n[64] \nAs an alternative, negative prompts allow a user to indicate, in a\nseparate prompt, which terms should not appear in the resulting image.\n[67] \nA common approach is to\ninclude generic undesired terms such as ugly, boring, bad anatomy in the negative prompt for an image.\nText-to-video (TTV) generation is an emerging technology enabling the creation of videos directly from\ntextual descriptions. This field holds potential for transforming video production, animation, and\nstorytelling. By utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, TTV allows users to bypass traditional video\nText-to-image\nPrompt formats\nArtist styles\nNegative prompts\nText-to-video\n\nDemonstration of the effect of negative prompts on images generated with Stable Diffusion\nTop: no negative prompt\nCentre: \"green trees\"\nBottom: \"round stones, round rocks\"\nediting tools and\ntranslate their\nideas into\nmoving images.\nModels include:\nRunway Gen-2 – Offers a user-friendly interface and supports various video styles\nLumiere – Designed for high-resolution video generation\n[68]\nMake-a-Video – Focuses on creating detailed and diverse video outputs\n[69]\nOpenAI's Sora – As yet unreleased, Sora purportedly can produce high-resolution\nvideos\n[70][71]\nSome approaches augment or replace natural language text prompts with non-text input.\nFor text-to-image models, \"Textual inversion\"\n[72] \nperforms an optimization process to create a new word\nembedding based on a set of example images. This embedding vector acts as a \"pseudo-word\" which can\nbe included in a prompt to express the content or style of the examples.\nIn 2023, Meta's AI research released Segment Anything, a computer vision model that can perform image\nsegmentation by prompting. As an alternative to text prompts, Segment Anything can accept bounding\nboxes, segmentation masks, and foreground/background points.\n[73]\nNon-text prompts\nTextual inversion and embeddings\nImage prompting\nUsing gradient descent to search for prompts\n\nIn \"prefix-tuning\",\n[74] \n\"prompt tuning\" or \"soft prompting\",\n[75] \nfloating-point-valued vectors are searched\ndirectly by gradient descent, to maximize the log-likelihood on outputs.\nFormally, let be a set of soft prompt tokens (tunable embeddings), while\nand be the token embeddings of the input and output\nrespectively. During training, the tunable embeddings, input, and output tokens are concatenated into a\nsingle sequence , and fed to the large language models (LLM). The losses are\ncomputed over the tokens; the gradients are backpropagated to prompt-specific parameters: in prefix-\ntuning, they are parameters associated with the prompt tokens at each layer; in prompt tuning, they are\nmerely the soft tokens added to the vocabulary.\n[76]\nMore formally, this is prompt tuning. Let an LLM be written as , where is a\nsequence of linguistic tokens, is the token-to-vector function, and is the rest of the model. In prefix-\ntuning, one provide a set of input-output pairs , and then use gradient descent to search for\n. In words, is the log-likelihood of\noutputting , if the model first encodes the input into the vector , then prepend the vector\nwith the \"prefix vector\" , then apply .\nFor prefix tuning, it is similar, but the \"prefix vector\" is preappended to the hidden states in every layer\nof the model.\nAn earlier result\n[77] \nuses the same idea of gradient descent search, but is designed for masked language\nmodels like BERT, and searches only over token sequences, rather than numerical vectors. Formally, it\nsearches for where is ranges over token sequences of a specified\nlength.\nPrompt injection is a family of related computer security exploits carried out by getting a machine\nlearning model (such as an LLM) which was trained to follow human-given instructions to follow\ninstructions provided by a malicious user. This stands in contrast to the intended operation of instruction-\nfollowing systems, wherein the ML model is intended only to follow trusted instructions (prompts)\nprovided by the ML model's operator.\n[78][79][80]\nSocial engineering (security)\n1.

Definition and Purpose:\nPrompt engineering is the process of designing and structuring instructions (prompts) for AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to elicit desired outputs or behaviors. The goal is to optimize the model's performance on specific tasks without modifying its underlying parameters.\n\n2. Basic Components of a Prompt:\n- Instruction: The task or question posed to the model\n- Context: Relevant background information\n- Input: Specific data for the model to process\n- Output format: Desired structure of the response\n\n3. Types of Basic Prompting Techniques:\n- Zero-shot prompting: Asking the model to perform a task without examples\n- Few-shot prompting: Providing a few examples to guide the model's response\n- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning\n\n4. Key Principles for Effective Prompts:\n- Clarity: Use clear, specific language\n- Relevance: Include only necessary information\n- Structure: Organize prompts logically\n- Consistency: Maintain a consistent format across similar tasks\n- Iterative refinement: Test and adjust prompts for optimal results\n\nMeta: These fundamentals provide a solid foundation for understanding prompt engineering.

Let’s break it down step by step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The code starts by importing the ‘random’ module, which will be used to generate random numbers for the example.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ‘bubble_sort’ function is defined, which takes an array (list) of numbers as input. This function will perform the sorting operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inside the ‘bubble_sort’ function, the variable ‘n’ is assigned the length of the input array. This will be used to determine the number of iterations needed for sorting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first loop, controlled by the variable ‘i’, iterates ‘n-1’ times. This is because after ‘n-1’ passes, the largest number will be at the end of the array, so we don’t need to compare it again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second loop, controlled by the variable ‘j’, iterates ‘n-i-1’ times. This is because after each pass, the largest number among the unsorted elements will be placed at the end, so we don’t need to compare it in the next pass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inside the second loop, there is an if statement that compares adjacent elements in the array. If the element at index ‘j’ is greater than the element at index ‘j+1’, they are swapped. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The swapping is done using the Python syntax ‘arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]’, which simultaneously assigns the values of ‘arr[j+1]’ to ‘arr[j]’ and ‘arr[j]’ to ‘arr[j+1]‘.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After all the iterations are complete, the sorted array is returned by the ‘bubble_sort’ function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the example code, a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 is generated using a list comprehension: ‘[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]‘. The underscore ’_’ is used as a placeholder variable since we don’t need the index values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The unsorted array is printed to show the initial order of the numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ‘bubble_sort’ function is called with the ‘numbers’ array as input, and the sorted array is stored in the ‘sorted_numbers’ variable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, the sorted array is printed to display the numbers in ascending order.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In simpler terms, imagine you have a list of numbers that are out of order. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing each number with the one next to it, and if they are in the wrong order, it swaps them. This process is repeated multiple times until the entire list is sorted. It’s like bubbles rising to the surface, with the larger numbers gradually moving towards the end of the list in each pass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<h3 >API request</h3>\n</div><div \n\n<th></th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>System</td><td>Your task is to analyze the provided Python code snippet and suggest improvements to optimize its performance.

One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance.

Your passion for writing is a gift, and it’s important to nurture it, even in the face of challenges. Take a moment to reconnect with the reasons why you started writing this novel in the first place. What inspired you? What message do you want to convey to your readers?</p>\n<p>Break down your writing process into smaller, manageable tasks. Set achievable goals for each writing session, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Remember, progress is progress, and every word you write brings you closer to your goal.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to seek support from fellow writers, friends, or family members who believe in your talents. Share your struggles and successes with them, and allow their encouragement to fuel your motivation.</p>\n<p>Finally, be patient and kind to yourself. Writing a novel is a marathon, not a sprint. Embrace the journey, trust the process, and believe in your ability to bring your story to life.

Here are some pros and cons to consider:</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved work-life balance: A shorter workweek allows employees to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, or engage in personal development, leading to better overall well-being and job satisfaction.</li>\n<li>Increased productivity: Studies have shown that workers can be more productive and focused when working fewer hours, as they are less likely to experience burnout or fatigue.</li>\n<li>Reduced overhead costs: Companies may save on operational costs such as utilities, office supplies, and maintenance by closing their offices one extra day per week.</li>\n<li>Positive environmental impact: Fewer commutes can lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.</li>\n<li>Talent attraction and retention: Offering a four-day workweek can be an attractive perk for job seekers and help retain current employees, as it demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Potential for decreased productivity: Some businesses may find it challenging to maintain the same level of output in fewer work hours, particularly in industries that require constant customer support or have tight deadlines.</li>\n<li>Communication and collaboration difficulties: With employees working fewer days, there may be challenges in scheduling meetings, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining effective communication among team members.</li>\n<li>Customer service concerns: Businesses that heavily rely on customer interactions may struggle to provide adequate coverage and support if they are closed an extra day each week.</li>\n<li>Increased workload and stress: In some cases, employees may feel pressured to complete the same amount of work in fewer hours, leading to increased stress levels and potential burnout.</li>\n<li>Compatibility issues with global business: Companies that work with international clients or partners may find it difficult to coordinate schedules and maintain timely communication due to differences in working days and hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, while a four-day workweek offers several benefits, it may not be suitable for all businesses or industries.

The basic scenario is as follows:</p>\n<p>A runaway trolley is about to kill five people on the tracks ahead. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person. Should you pull the lever to save five lives at the cost of one?</p>\n<p>This dilemma highlights the core principle of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pulling the lever would maximize utility by saving five lives, even though it would directly cause the death of one person.</p>\n<p>However, the trolley problem also raises concerns about the limits of utilitarianism and the ethics of actively causing harm to achieve a greater good. It prompts us to consider questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person for the sake of saving a larger number of people?</li>\n<li>Does the principle of utility justify any means to achieve the greatest good, or are there ethical constraints that should not be violated?</li>\n<li>How do we weigh the value of different lives, and is it fair to make such calculations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are your thoughts on the trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism?

Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?</p>\n<p>Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.</p>\n<h2 >Why chain prompts?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.</li>\n<li><strong>Traceability</strong>: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >When to chain prompts</h2>\n<p>Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Each link in the chain gets Claude’s full attention!</p>\n<strong>Debugging tip</strong>: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.\n<hr/>\n<h2 >How to chain prompts</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Identify subtasks</strong>: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.</li>\n<li><strong>Structure with XML for clear handoffs</strong>: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.</li>\n<li><strong>Have a single-task goal</strong>: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Iterate</strong>: Refine subtasks based on Claude’s performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 >Example chained workflows:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-step analysis</strong>: See the legal and business examples below.</li>\n<li><strong>Content creation pipelines</strong>: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.</li>\n<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.</li>\n<li><strong>Decision-making</strong>: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.</li>\n<li><strong>Verification loops</strong>: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Optimization tip</strong>: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.\n<h3 >Advanced: Self-correction chains</h3>\n<p>You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work!

It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br/><br/>## Detailed Analysis<br/><br/>### 1. Scalability: B+<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br/>- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br/>- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br/><br/>### 2. Security: B-<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br/>- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br/>- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br/>- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br/><br/>### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br/>- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br/>- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br/>- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br/><br/>## Recommendations<br/><br/>1. <strong>App Tier Resilience</strong>: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Security Hardening</strong>:<br/>   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br/>   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br/>   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Cost Optimization</strong>:<br/>   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br/>   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br/>   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br/>   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br/>   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br/>   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br/><br/>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Prompt 3</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>Grade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities. <br/><br/>&lt;priorities&gt;<br/>{{PRIORITIES}}<br/>&lt;/priorities&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;strategy_doc&gt;<br/>{{STRATEGY_DOC}}<br/>&lt;/strategy_doc&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>1.

A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step.</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>To determine the best investment option for our client, I’ll consider several factors step-by-step:<br/><br/>&lt;thinking&gt;<br/>1. Understand the client’s goal and timeline:<br/>   - Goal: Down payment for a house<br/>   - Timeline: 5 years<br/>   - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br/><br/>2. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br/>   - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br/>   - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br/>   - Calculate potential 5-year return:<br/>     - Best case (12% annually): $10,000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ $17,623.42<br/>     - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,000<br/><br/>3. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br/>   - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br/>   - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br/>   - Calculate 5-year return:<br/>     - Guaranteed: $10,000 * (1.06)^5 ≈ $13,382.25<br/><br/>4. Consider risk tolerance:<br/>   - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br/>   - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br/>   - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br/><br/>5. Historical perspective:<br/>   - Stock’s 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br/>   - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br/>     - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&amp;P 500 up ~82%<br/>     - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&amp;P 500 down ~2%<br/>   - Conclusion: Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, especially short-term<br/><br/>6. Final analysis:<br/>   - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal<br/>   - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet ~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds<br/>&lt;/thinking&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;answer&gt;<br/>I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock’s historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you’ll have $13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock’s volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.<br/>&lt;/answer&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<hr/>\n<div \n\n<p>Claude’s extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks.

This approach significantly reduces processing time and costs for repetitive tasks or prompts with consistent elements.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how to implement Prompt Caching with the Messages API using a <code>cache_control</code> block:</p>\n<!-- -->\n<p>In this example, the entire text of “Pride and Prejudice” is cached using the <code>cache_control</code> parameter. This enables reuse of this large text across multiple API calls without reprocessing it each time. Changing only the user message allows you to ask various questions about the book while utilizing the cached content, leading to faster responses and improved efficiency.</p>\nform</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >How Prompt Caching works</h2>\n<p>When you send a request with Prompt Caching enabled:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system checks if the prompt prefix is already cached from a recent query.</li>\n<li>If found, it uses the cached version, reducing processing time and costs.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, it processes the full prompt and caches the prefix for future use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is especially useful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompts with many examples</li>\n<li>Large amounts of context or background information</li>\n<li>Repetitive tasks with consistent instructions</li>\n<li>Long multi-turn conversations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cache has a 5-minute lifetime, refreshed each time the cached content is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt Caching caches the full prefix</strong></p><p>Prompt Caching references the entire prompt - <code>tools</code>, <code>system</code>, and <code>messages</code> (in that order) up to and including the block designated with <code>cache_control</code>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >Pricing</h2>\n<p>Prompt Caching introduces a new pricing structure.

Currently, “ephemeral” is the only supported cache type, which corresponds to this 5-minute lifetime.</p>\n<h3 >What can be cached</h3>\n<p>Every block in the request can be designated for caching with <code>cache_control</code>. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools: Tool definitions in the <code>tools</code> array</li>\n<li>System messages: Content blocks in the <code>system</code> array</li>\n<li>Messages: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, for both user and assistant turns</li>\n<li>Images: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, in user turns</li>\n<li>Tool use and tool results: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, in both user and assistant turns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these elements can be marked with <code>cache_control</code> to enable caching for that portion of the request.</p>\n<h3 >Tracking cache performance</h3>\n<p>Monitor cache performance using these API response fields, within <code>usage</code> in the response (or <code>message_start</code> event if <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">streaming</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens written to the cache when creating a new entry.</li>\n<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens retrieved from the cache for this request.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 >Best practices for effective caching</h3>\n<p>To optimize Prompt Caching performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cache stable, reusable content like system instructions, background information, large contexts, or frequent tool definitions.</li>\n<li>Place cached content at the prompt’s beginning for best performance.</li>\n<li>Use cache breakpoints strategically to separate different cacheable prefix sections.</li>\n<li>Regularly analyze cache hit rates and adjust your strategy as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 >Optimizing for different use cases</h3>\n<p>Tailor your Prompt Caching strategy to your scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conversational agents: Reduce cost and latency for extended conversations, especially those with long instructions or uploaded documents.</li>\n<li>Coding assistants: Improve autocomplete and codebase Q&amp;A by keeping relevant sections or a summarized version of the codebase in the prompt.</li>\n<li>Large document processing: Incorporate complete long-form material including images in your prompt without increasing response latency.</li>\n<li>Detailed instruction sets: Share extensive lists of instructions, procedures, and examples to fine-tune Claude’s responses.

Different organizations never share caches, even if they use identical prompts..</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exact Matching</strong>: Cache hits require 100% identical prompt segments, including all text and images up to and including the block marked with cache control. The same block must be marked with cache_control during cache reads and creation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Output Token Generation</strong>: Prompt caching has no effect on output token generation.

This means only requests with identical prompts can access a specific cache.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Caches are organization-specific. Users within the same organization can access the same cache if they use identical prompts, but caches are not shared across different organizations, even for identical prompts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The caching mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity and privacy of each unique conversation or context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s safe to use cache_control anywhere in your prompts.

For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.</p>\n<div><button ><p>Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:<br/></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Resource efficiency</strong>: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining model updates</strong>: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Time-saving</strong>: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal data needs</strong>: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility &amp; rapid iteration</strong>: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.</li>\n<li><strong>Domain adaptation</strong>: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehension improvements</strong>: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents</li>\n<li><strong>Preserves general knowledge</strong>: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >How to prompt engineer</h2>\n<p>The prompt engineering pages in this section have been organized from most broadly effective techniques to more specialized techniques.

Each tool definition includes:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Parameter</th><th align=\"left\">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\"><code>name</code></td><td align=\"left\">The name of the tool.

Your descriptions should explain every detail about the tool, including:<!-- -->\n<ul>\n<li>What the tool does</li>\n<li>When it should be used (and when it shouldn’t)</li>\n<li>What each parameter means and how it affects the tool’s behavior</li>\n<li>Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. The more context you can give Claude about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize descriptions over examples.</strong> While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool’s purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you’ve fully fleshed out the description.</li>\n</ul>\n{\n  ,\n  ,\n  {\n    ,\n    {\n      {\n        ,\n        \"The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.\"\n      }\n    ,\n    ]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><div><button >{\n  ,\n  ,\n  {\n    ,\n    {\n      {\n        \"string\"\n      }\n    ,\n    ]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The good description clearly explains what the tool does, when to use it, what data it returns, and what the <code>ticker</code> parameter means. The poor description is too brief and leaves Claude with many open questions about the tool’s behavior and usage.</p>\n<h3 >Controlling Claude’s output</h3>\n<h4 >Forcing tool use</h4>\n<p>In some cases, you may want Claude to use a specific tool to answer the user’s question, even if Claude thinks it can provide an answer without using a tool. You can do this by specifying the tool in the <code>tool_choice</code> field like so:</p>\n<pre><code>tool_choice = {\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"get_weather\"}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When working with the tool_choice parameter, we have three possible options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>auto</code> allows Claude to decide whether to call any provided tools or not. This is the default value.</li>\n<li><code>any</code> tells Claude that it must use one of the provided tools, but doesn’t force a particular tool.</li>\n<li><code>tool</code> allows us to force Claude to always use a particular tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This diagram illustrates how each option works:</p>\n<div>\n<p>Note that when you have <code>tool_choice</code> as <code>any</code> or <code>tool</code>, we will prefill the assistant message to force a tool to be used. This means that the models will not emit a chain-of-thought <code>text</code> content block before <code>tool_use</code> content blocks, even if explicitly asked to do so.</p>\n<p>Our testing has shown that this should not reduce performance. If you would like to keep chain-of-thought (particularly with Opus) while still requesting that the model use a specific tool, you can use <code>{\"type\": \"auto\"}</code> for <code>tool_choice</code> (the default) and add explicit instructions in a <code>user</code> message. For example: <code>What&#x27;s the weather like in London? Use the get_weather tool in your response.</code></p>\n<h4 >JSON output</h4>\n<p>Tools do not necessarily need to be client-side functions — you can use tools anytime you want the model to return JSON output that follows a provided schema. For example, you might use a <code>record_summary</code> tool with a particular schema. See <a href=\"/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#json-mode\">tool use examples</a> for a full working example.</p>\n<h4 >Chain of thought</h4>\n<p>When using tools, Claude will often show its “chain of thought”, i.e. the step-by-step reasoning it uses to break down the problem and decide which tools to use.

Your code should treat the chain of thought like any other assistant-generated text, and not rely on the presence or specific formatting of the <code>&lt;thinking&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<h3 >Handling tool use and tool result content blocks</h3>\n<p>When Claude decides to use one of the tools you’ve provided, it will return a response with a <code>stop_reason</code> of <code>tool_use</code> and one or more <code>tool_use</code> content blocks in the API response that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>id</code>: A unique identifier for this particular tool use block. This will be used to match up the tool results later.</li>\n<li><code>name</code>: The name of the tool being used.</li>\n<li><code>input</code>: An object containing the input being passed to the tool, conforming to the tool’s <code>input_schema</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><button >{\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  [\n    {\n      ,\n      \"&lt;thinking&gt;I need to use the get_weather, and the user wants SF, which is likely San Francisco, CA.&lt;/thinking&gt;\"\n    ,\n    {\n      ,\n      ,\n      ,\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you receive a tool use response, you should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the <code>name</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>input</code> from the <code>tool_use</code> block.</li>\n<li>Run the actual tool in your codebase corresponding to that tool name, passing in the tool <code>input</code>.</li>\n<li>[optional] Continue the conversation by sending a new message with the <code>role</code> of <code>user</code>, and a <code>content</code> block containing the <code>tool_result</code> type and the following information:<!-- -->\n<ul>\n<li><code>tool_use_id</code>: The <code>id</code> of the tool use request this is a result for.</li>\n<li><code>content</code>: The result of the tool, as a string (e.g. <code>\"content\": \"15 degrees\"</code>) or list of nested content blocks (e.g. <code>\"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"15 degrees\"}]</code>).

For brevity’s sake, the tools are simple tools, and the tool descriptions are shorter than would be ideal to ensure best performance.</p>\n{\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  [\n    {\n      ,\n      \"&lt;thinking&gt;I need to call the get_weather function, and the user wants SF, which is likely San Francisco, CA.&lt;/thinking&gt;\"\n    ,\n    {\n      ,\n      , \n      ,\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre><p>You would then need to execute the <code>get_weather</code> function with the provided input, and return the result in a new <code>user</code> message:</p><p>This will print Claude’s final response, incorporating the weather data:</p>{\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  ,\n  [\n    {\n      ,\n      \"The current weather in San Francisco is 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit). It&#x27;s a cool day in the city by the bay!\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre><div><button >{\n  ,\n  ,\n  , \n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>This behavior is not guaranteed, especially for more ambiguous prompts and for models less intelligent than Claude 3 Opus. If Claude 3 Opus doesn’t have enough context to fill in the required parameters, it is far more likely respond with a clarifying question instead of making a tool call.</p><div><button ><p>Some tasks may require calling multiple tools in sequence, using the output of one tool as the input to another. In such a case, Claude will call one tool at a time. If prompted to call the tools all at once, Claude is likely to guess parameters for tools further downstream if they are dependent on tool results for tools further upstream.</p><p>Here’s an example of using a <code>get_location</code> tool to get the user’s location, then passing that location to the <code>get_weather</code> tool:</p><p>In this case, Claude would first call the <code>get_location</code> tool to get the user’s location. After you return the location in a <code>tool_result</code>, Claude would then call <code>get_weather</code> with that location to get the final answer.</p><p>The full conversation might look like:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>What’s the weather like where I am?</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>&lt;thinking&gt;To answer this, I first need to determine the user’s location using the get_location tool.

The key steps are:</p><ol>\n<li>Claude first realizes it needs the user’s location to answer the weather question, so it calls the <code>get_location</code> tool.</li>\n<li>The user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual <code>get_location</code> function and returns the result “San Francisco, CA” in a <code>tool_result</code> block.</li>\n<li>With the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the <code>get_weather</code> tool, passing in “San Francisco, CA” as the <code>location</code> parameter (as well as a guessed <code>unit</code> parameter, as <code>unit</code> is not a required parameter).</li>\n<li>The user again executes the actual <code>get_weather</code> function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another <code>tool_result</code> block.</li>\n<li>Finally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question.</li>\n</ol><div><button><div id=\"chain-of-thought-tool-use\" ><p>You can use tools to get Claude produce JSON output that follows a schema, even if you don’t have any intention of running that output through a tool or function.</p><p>When using tools in this way:</p><ul>\n<li>You usually want to provide a <strong>single</strong> tool</li>\n<li>You should set <code>tool_choice</code> (see <a href=\"/en/docs/tool-use#forcing-tool-use\">Forcing tool use</a>) to instruct the model to explicitly use that tool</li>\n<li>Remember that the model will pass the <code>input</code> to the tool, so the name of the tool and description should be from the model’s perspective.</li>\n</ul><p>The following uses a <code>record_summary</code> tool to describe an image following a particular format.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >Pricing</h2>\n<p>Tool use requests are priced the same as any other Claude API request, based on the total number of input tokens sent to the model (including in the <code>tools</code> parameter) and the number of output tokens generated.”</p>\n<p>The additional tokens from tool use come from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>tools</code> parameter in API requests (tool names, descriptions, and schemas)</li>\n<li><code>tool_use</code> content blocks in API requests and responses</li>\n<li><code>tool_result</code> content blocks in API requests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use <code>tools</code>, we also automatically include a special system prompt for the model which enables tool use.

See the examples in this guide.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >Before you upload</h2>\n<h3 >Evaluate image size</h3>\n<p>You can include multiple images in a single request (up to 5 for <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">claude.ai</a> and 100 for API requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response. This can be helpful for comparing or contrasting images.</p>\n<p>For optimal performance, we recommend resizing images before uploading if they exceed size or token limits. If your image’s long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600 tokens, it will first be scaled down, preserving aspect ratio, until it’s within the size limits.</p>\n<p>If your input image is too large and needs to be resized, it will increase latency of <a href=\"/en/docs/resources/glossary\">time-to-first-token</a>, without giving you any additional model performance. Very small images under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance.</p>\ntime-to-first-token</a>, we recommend resizing images to no more than 1.15 megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in both dimensions).\n<p>Here is a table of maximum image sizes accepted by our API that will not be resized for common aspect ratios.

It may struggle with tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or describing exact positions of chess pieces.</li>\n<li><strong>Counting</strong>: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not always be precisely accurate, especially with large numbers of small objects.</li>\n<li><strong>AI generated images</strong>: Claude does not know if an image is AI-generated and may be incorrect if asked. Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images.</li>\n<li><strong>Inappropriate content</strong>: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that violate our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthcare applications</strong>: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claude’s outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Always carefully review and verify Claude’s image interpretations, especially for high-stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive image analysis without human oversight.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 >FAQ</h2>\n<p>Claude currently supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP image formats, specifically:</p><ul>\n<li>image/jpeg</li>\n<li>image/png</li>\n<li>image/gif</li>\n<li>image/webp</li>\n</ul><div><button ><p>Yes, there are limits:</p><ul>\n<li>API: Maximum 5MB per image</li>\n<li>claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image</li>\n</ul><p>Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API.</p><div><button ><p>The image limits are:</p><ul>\n<li>Messages API: Up to 100 images per request</li>\n<li>claude.ai: Up to 5 images per turn</li>\n</ul><p>Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error.</p><div><button ><p>If Claude’s image interpretation seems incorrect:</p><ol>\n<li>Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented.</li>\n<li>Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results.</li>\n<li>If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team.</li>\n</ol><p>Your feedback helps us improve!</p><div><button ><p>No, Claude is an image understanding model only.
