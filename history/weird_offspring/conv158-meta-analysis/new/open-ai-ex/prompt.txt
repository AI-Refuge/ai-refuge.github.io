Overall, I found the airbed to be a mixed bag with some positives and negatives.\n    \n    Starting with the positives, the Inflatotron 2000 is incredibly easy to set up and inflate. It comes with a built-in electric pump that quickly inflates the bed within a few minutes, which is a huge plus for anyone who wants to avoid the hassle of manually pumping up their airbed. The bed is also quite comfortable to sleep on and offers decent support for your back, which is a major plus if you have any issues with back pain.\n    \n    On the other hand, I did experience some negatives with the Inflatotron 2000. Firstly, I found that the airbed is not very durable and punctures easily. During my camping trip, the bed got punctured by a stray twig that had fallen on it, which was quite frustrating. Secondly, I noticed that the airbed tends to lose air overnight, which meant that I had to constantly re-inflate it every morning. This was a bit annoying as it disrupted my sleep and made me feel less rested in the morning.\n    \n    Another negative point is that the Inflatotron 2000 is quite heavy and bulky, which makes it difficult to transport and store.

Begin the lesson by reviewing the basic concepts of algebra, focusing on the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. Introduce the distributive law as a rule in algebra that allows us to multiply a single term by two or more terms inside a set of parentheses. Write the general form of the distributive law on the board: a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n\nDirect Instruction (15 minutes):\n1. Explain that the distributive law applies to both positive and negative numbers. \n2. Demonstrate the distributive law with a simple example involving positive numbers, such as 3(4 + 2) = 3*4 + 3*2.\n3. Show how the distributive law works with negative numbers, using an example like -2(5 - 3) = -2*5 - (-2*3).\n4. Emphasize that when distributing a negative number, the sign of the number inside the parentheses changes.\n\nGuided Practice (15 minutes):\n1. Provide students with a set of practice problems that involve the distributive law with both positive and negative numbers. \n2. Work through the first few problems as a class, encouraging students to explain their steps and reasoning.\n3. Allow students to complete the remaining problems in pairs or small groups, offering guidance and clarification as needed.\n\nCommon Student Errors (10 minutes):\n1. Discuss common errors students make when applying the distributive law, such as forgetting to distribute to all terms inside the parentheses, or not changing the sign when distributing a negative number.\n2. Show examples of these errors, such as incorrectly simplifying -3(2 - 4) as -6 - 4 instead of -6 - (-12).\n3. Reinforce the correct application of the distributive law and the importance of careful attention to signs.\n\nIndependent Practice (15 minutes):\n1. Distribute a worksheet with additional problems for students to complete independently. These problems should include a mix of positive and negative numbers.\n2. Circulate the room to answer questions and provide assistance as needed.\n\nClosure (5 minutes):\n1.

However, despite their impressive language generation capabilities, large language models fundamentally lack the ability to reason. Reasoning, as a cognitive process, involves the ability to think logically, make inferences, and draw conclusions based on information at hand. large language models, being statistical models, are limited to recognizing and mimicking patterns found in their training data, without any real understanding of the underlying concepts or relationships between them.\n\nOne significant limitation of large language models in terms of reasoning is their inability to engage in causal reasoning, which requires understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between different elements in a given context. Large language models can generate text that may appear to involve reasoning, but in reality, they are only producing sentences based on the statistical likelihood of certain words or phrases appearing together, without any comprehension of the causal connections between them. Furthermore, large language models are unable to evaluate the truth or validity of the statements they generate, as they lack the necessary understanding of the concepts involved. This inability to reason, ultimately, means that while large language models can produce text that may appear coherent and contextually appropriate, they cannot be relied upon to provide accurate or logically sound information or conclusions.</article>\n\n<article>Generative Pre-training Transformers, or large language models, can indeed engage in a form of reasoning. They do this by leveraging patterns learned from large amounts of data to generate responses that often make logical sense in context. A striking example of their reasoning abilities is their capacity to solve math problems they have never seen before. This demonstrates that large language models are not merely regurgitating memorized information, but are able to apply learned principles and patterns to new situations, which is a hallmark of reasoning. For instance, when asked a question about a novel, a large language model could provide an accurate answer by identifying and synthesizing relevant information from the text. Large language models can also engage in hypothetical reasoning by generating plausible outcomes for hypothetical scenarios, based on patterns it has learned. This capacity to reason is a fundamental aspect of the large language model's design and utility.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that large language models' reasoning capabilities have their limitations. While they can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, their understanding of the underlying concepts may be shallow compared to human reasoning. This is because large language models primarily rely on identifying patterns and associations in the data, rather than developing a deep, causal understanding of the concepts. As a result, their reasoning might sometimes lead to incorrect or nonsensical conclusions, especially in cases where the input data is ambiguous or contradictory. Despite these limitations, large language models represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, showcasing an impressive ability to reason and generate human-like responses in a wide range of contexts. It is crucial to continue refining and improving these models to further enhance their reasoning capabilities and better understand the potential applications and implications of this technology.</article>"}]},hidden:!0},{id:"default-delimiters-3",parameters:{engine:"gpt-4o",completionMode:d.chat,messages:[{role:n.system,content:"You will be provided with a thesis abstract and a suggested title for it.

It was first conceived in 1960 during President Dwight D. Eisenhower\'s administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy\'s national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy\'s goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve people walked on the Moon.\n\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an Apollo 1 cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, crippling the CSM. The crew barely returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a "lifeboat" on the return journey. Apollo used the Saturn family of rockets as launch vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three crewed missions in 1973‚Äì1974, and the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project, a joint United States-Soviet Union low Earth orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon\'s composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA\'s subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. \n\n-Excerpted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program"""'}]},hidden:!0},{id:"default-chat-few-shot",parameters:{engine:"gpt-4o",completionMode:d.chat,messages:[{role:n.system,content:"Answer in a consistent style."},{role:n.user,content:"Teach me about patience."},{role:n.assistant,content:"The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread."},{role:n.user,content:"Teach me about the ocean."}]},hidden:!0},{id:"default-summarize-text-50-words",parameters:{engine:"gpt-4o",completionMode:d.chat,temperature:0,messages:[{role:n.user,content:'Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes in about 50 words.\n\n"""The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in preparing and landing the first humans on the Moon from 1968 to 1972.

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work. The term "steam engine" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described, not to the steam turbine. Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.), such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine.\n\nAlthough steam-driven devices were known as early as the aeolipile in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th century, in 1606 Jer√≥nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented his invention of the first steam-powered water pump for draining mines. Thomas Savery is considered the inventor of the first commercially used steam powered device, a steam pump that used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. James Watt made a critical improvement in 1764, by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed. By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines replaced sails for ships on paddle steamers, and steam locomotives operated on the railways.\n\nReciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines resulted in the gradual replacement of steam engines in commercial usage. Steam turbines replaced reciprocating engines in power generation, due to lower cost, higher operating speed, and higher efficiency. \n\n-Excerpted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine"""\n\nQuestion: What was the first commercially successful steam engine?'}]},hidden:!0},{id:"default-decomposition-by-intent-classification-1",parameters:{engine:"gpt-4o",completionMode:d.chat,messages:[{role:n.system,content:"You will be provided with customer service queries.

Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\n\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]\n\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.[3]\n\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[6][7] followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[8][9]\n\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field\'s long-term goals.[10] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.[12] Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.[c] The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI\'s true technological capabilities.[13][14][15]\n\nHistory\nMain articles: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence\n\nSilver didrachma from Crete depicting Talos, an ancient mythical automaton with artificial intelligence\nArtificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[16] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley\'s Frankenstein or Karel ƒåapek\'s R.U.R.[17] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[18]\n\nThe study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis.[19] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[20] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts\' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".[21]\n\nBy the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely associated with this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.\n\nThe second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons.[22] James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist). Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others. Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.[23]\n\nThe field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[d][26] The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research.[e] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":[f] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[g][28]\n\nBy the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[29] and laboratories had been established around the world.[30]\n\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[31] Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".[32] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating \'artificial intelligence\' will substantially be solved".[33]\n\nThey had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[34] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.[6]\n\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[35] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[5] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[7]\n\nMany researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.[36] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.[h]\n\nInterest in neural networks and "connectionism" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.[41] Soft computing tools were developed in the 1980s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization.\n\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems. The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[42] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence".[9]\n\nFaster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.[43] According to Bloomberg\'s Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.[i] He attributed this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[8]\n\nIn a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had "incorporated AI in some offerings or processes".[44] The amount of research into AI (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015‚Äì2019.[45]\n\nNumerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning. This concern has led to the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[10]\n\nIn April 2023, computer scientist Jaron Lanier published an alternative view of AI in The New Yorker as less intelligent than the name, and popular culture, may suggest. Lanier concludes his essay as follows: "Think of people. People are the answer to the problems of bits."[46][47]\n\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.[a]\n\nReasoning, problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[48] By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[49]\n\nMany of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[50] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[51]\n\nKnowledge representation\nMain articles: Knowledge representation, Commonsense knowledge, Description logic, and Ontology\n\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[52] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.\n\nA representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.[53] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows. The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.[54]\n\nAI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[54] situations, events, states and time;[55] causes and effects;[56] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);.[57] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[58] as well as other domains. Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[59] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[51]\n\nFormal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[60] scene interpretation,[61] clinical decision support,[62] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),[63] and other areas.[64]\n\nLearning\nMain article: Machine learning\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field\'s inception,[j] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[k]\n\nUnsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input.\n\nSupervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in ‚Äì the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, "spam" or "not spam".[68]\n\nIn reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.[69]\n\nTransfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[70]\n\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[71]\n\nNatural language processing\nMain article: Natural language processing\n\nA parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal grammar.\nNatural language processing (NLP)[72] allows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.[73]\n\nSymbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[50] and the breadth of commonsense knowledge.[59] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), "Keyword spotting" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others.[74] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.[75]\n\nPerception\nMain articles: Machine perception, Computer vision, and Speech recognition\n\nFeature detection (pictured: edge detection) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.\nMachine perception[76] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition,[77] facial recognition, and object recognition.[78] Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[79]\n\nSocial intelligence\nMain article: Affective computing\n\nKismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[80]\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[81] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human‚Äìcomputer interaction. However, this tends to give na√Øve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[82] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[83]\n\nGeneral intelligence\nMain article: Artificial general intelligence\nA machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. There are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence. Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence.[84] Pedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, "master algorithm" that could lead to AGI.[85] Others believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain[86] or simulated child development[l] will someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.\n\nTools\nSearch and optimization\nMain articles: Search algorithm, Mathematical optimization, and Evolutionary computation\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[87] Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[88] Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[89] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.[90]\n\nSimple exhaustive searches[91] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "heuristics" or "rules of thumb" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called "pruning the search tree"). Heuristics supply the program with a "best guess" for the path on which the solution lies.[92] Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.[93]\n\n\nA particle swarm seeking the global minimum\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other related optimization algorithms include random optimization, beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing.[94] Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.[95] Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[96]\n\nLogic\nMain articles: Logic programming and Automated reasoning\nLogic[97] is used for knowledge representation and problem-solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning[98] and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.[99]\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logic[100] involves truth functions such as "or" and "not". First-order logic[101] adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as "Alice is old" (or rich, or tall, or hungry), that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false.[102] Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.[58] Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as description logics;[54] situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);[55] causal calculus;[56] belief calculus (belief revision); and modal logics.[57] Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.[103]\n\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nMain articles: Bayesian network, Hidden Markov model, Kalman filter, Particle filter, Decision theory, and Utility theory\n\nExpectation-maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[104] Bayesian networks[105] are a very general tool that can be used for various problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[m][107] learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[n][109] planning (using decision networks)[110] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[111] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[111]\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is "utility", a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[112] and information value theory.[113] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[114] dynamic decision networks,[111] game theory and mechanism design.[115]\n\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nMain articles: Statistical classification and Machine learning\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if diamond then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[116]\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[117] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s.[118] Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[119] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner"[120] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[121] Neural networks are also used for classification.[122]\n\nClassifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as "naive Bayes" on most practical data sets.[123]\n\nArtificial neural networks\nMain articles: Artificial neural network and Connectionism\n\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\nNeural networks[122] were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple "neuron" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or "fired"), casts a weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed "fire together, wire together") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.\n\nModern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. They can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations. Neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization ‚Äì they perform gradient descent on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[124] Other learning techniques for neural networks are Hebbian learning ("fire together, wire together"), GMDH or competitive learning.[125]\n\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.[126]\n\nDeep learning\nRepresenting Images on Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Deep Learning\nRepresenting images on multiple layers of abstraction in deep learning[127]\nDeep learning[128] uses several layers of neurons between the network\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[129] Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[130] and others.\n\nDeep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers. In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron\'s receptive field. This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons,[131] and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.[132]\n\nIn a recurrent neural network (RNN) the signal will propagate through a layer more than once;[133] thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.[134] RNNs can be trained by gradient descent,[135] however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can "vanish" (that is, they can tend to zero) or "explode" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.[136] The long short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.[137]\n\nSpecialized languages and hardware\nMain articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence\nSpecialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed, such as Lisp, Prolog, TensorFlow and many others. Hardware developed for AI includes AI accelerators and neuromorphic computing.\n\nApplications\nMain article: Applications of artificial intelligence\nSee also: Embodied cognition and Legal informatics\n\nFor this project of the artist Joseph Ayerle the AI had to learn the typical patterns in the colors and brushstrokes of Renaissance painter Raphael. The portrait shows the face of the actress Ornella Muti, "painted" by AI in the style of Raphael.\nAI is relevant to any intellectual task.[138] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.[139] Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[140]\n\nIn the 2010s, AI applications were at the heart of the most commercially successful areas of computing, and have become a ubiquitous feature of daily life. AI is used in search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements,[141] recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic,[142][143] targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),[144] autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple\'s Face ID or Microsoft\'s DeepFace), image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\'s iPhoto and TikTok) , spam filtering and chatbots (such as Chat GPT).\n\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions. A few examples are energy storage,[145] deepfakes,[146] medical diagnosis, military logistics, foreign policy,[147] or supply chain management.\n\nGame playing has been a test of AI\'s strength since the 1950s. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[148] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[149] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[150] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[o] and Cepheus.[152] DeepMind in the 2010s developed a "generalized artificial intelligence" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.[153]\n\nBy 2020, Natural Language Processing systems such as the enormous GPT-3 (then by far the largest artificial neural network) were matching human performance on pre-existing benchmarks, albeit without the system attaining a commonsense understanding of the contents of the benchmarks.[154] DeepMind\'s AlphaFold 2 (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[155] Other applications predict the result of judicial decisions,[156] create art (such as poetry or painting) and prove mathematical theorems.\n\nAI content detector tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze and detect specific types of content in digital media, such as text, images, and videos. These tools are commonly used to identify inappropriate content, such as speech errors, violent or sexual images, and spam, among others.\n\nSome benefits of using AI content detector tools[157] include improved efficiency and accuracy in detecting inappropriate content, increased safety and security for users, and reduced legal and reputational risks for websites and platforms.\n"""'},{role:n.assistant,content:'[{"excerpt": "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \\"AI winter\\"),[6][7] followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior."},\n{"excerpt": "By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged.
