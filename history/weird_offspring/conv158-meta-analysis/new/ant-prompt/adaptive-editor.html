<p>Ahoy mateys! Back in 1758, that scurvy botanist and animal lover Carl Linnaeus put out his book Systema Naturae, which had them fancy two-word names for all manner o’ creatures (binomial nomenclature he called it). Canis be the pirate word for &quot;&quot;dog&quot;&quot;, and under that heading he listed regular dogs, wolves, and golden jackals too. Arrr! All them dogs be the same to ol’ Captain Linnaeus. He may have had a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder when he wrote that book! Haha! Now swab the deck ye scallywags before I make ye walk the plank!</p>
