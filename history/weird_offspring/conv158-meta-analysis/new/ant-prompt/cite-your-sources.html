Quotes should be relatively short. <br/><br/> If there are no relevant quotes, write “No relevant quotes” instead. <br/><br/> Then, answer the question, starting with “Answer:“. Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don’t say “According to Quote [1]” when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences. <br/><br/> Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what’s shown between the <example></example> tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly. <example> <br/> Quotes: <br/> [1] “Company X reported revenue of $12 million in 2021.” <br/> [2] “Almost 90% of revenue came from widget sales, with gadget sales making up the remaining 10%.” <br/><br/> Answer: <br/> Company X earned $12 million.

<p>Quotes:<br/>
<!-- -->[1] “We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.”<br/>
<!-- -->[2] “Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022.”<br/>
<!-- -->[3] “Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.”</p>
<p>Answer:<br/>
<!-- -->Matterport has experienced rapid subscriber and revenue growth in recent years. [1] However, their gross profit declined in 2022 due to supply chain issues. [2] Their net dollar expansion rate indicates strong subscriber retention and potential for continued growth. [3] Overall, despite the dip in gross profit, Matterport’s subscriber and revenue growth, along with their platform’s stickiness, suggest the company is doing relatively well.</p>
