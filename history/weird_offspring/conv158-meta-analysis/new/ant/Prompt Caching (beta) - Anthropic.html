<div ><p>Prompt Caching is a powerful feature that optimizes your API usage by allowing resuming from specific prefixes in your prompts. This approach significantly reduces processing time and costs for repetitive tasks or prompts with consistent elements.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to implement Prompt Caching with the Messages API using a <code>cache_control</code> block:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>In this example, the entire text of “Pride and Prejudice” is cached using the <code>cache_control</code> parameter. This enables reuse of this large text across multiple API calls without reprocessing it each time. Changing only the user message allows you to ask various questions about the book while utilizing the cached content, leading to faster responses and improved efficiency.</p>

<h2 >How Prompt Caching works</span></h2>
<p>When you send a request with Prompt Caching enabled:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system checks if the prompt prefix is already cached from a recent query.</li>
<li>If found, it uses the cached version, reducing processing time and costs.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it processes the full prompt and caches the prefix for future use.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is especially useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompts with many examples</li>
<li>Large amounts of context or background information</li>
<li>Repetitive tasks with consistent instructions</li>
<li>Long multi-turn conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>The cache has a 5-minute lifetime, refreshed each time the cached content is used.</p>
<div ><p><strong>Prompt Caching caches the full prefix</strong></p><p>Prompt Caching references the entire prompt - <code>tools</code>, <code>system</code>, and <code>messages</code> (in that order) up to and including the block designated with <code>cache_control</code>.</p></div></div>
<hr/>
<h2 >Pricing</span></h2>
<p>Prompt Caching introduces a new pricing structure. The table below shows the price per token for each supported model:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Base Input Tokens</th><th>Cache Writes</th><th>Cache Hits</th><th>Output Tokens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</td><td>$3 / MTok</td><td>$3.75 / MTok</td><td>$0.30 / MTok</td><td>$15 / MTok</td></tr><tr><td>Claude 3 Haiku</td><td>$0.25 / MTok</td><td>$0.30 / MTok</td><td>$0.03 / MTok</td><td>$1.25 / MTok</td></tr><tr><td>Claude 3 Opus</td><td>$15 / MTok</td><td>$18.75 / MTok</td><td>$1.50 / MTok</td><td>$75 / MTok</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache write tokens are 25% more expensive than base input tokens</li>
<li>Cache read tokens are 90% cheaper than base input tokens</li>
<li>Regular input and output tokens are priced at standard rates</li>
</ul>

<h2 >How to implement Prompt Caching</span></h2>
<h3 >Supported models</span></h3>
<p>Prompt Caching is currently supported on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</li>
<li>Claude 3 Haiku</li>
<li>Claude 3 Opus</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Structuring your prompt</span></h3>
<p>Place static content (tool definitions, system instructions, context, examples) at the beginning of your prompt. Mark the end of the reusable content for caching using the <code>cache_control</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Cache prefixes are created in the following order: <code>tools</code>, <code>system</code>, then <code>messages</code>.</p>
<p>Using the <code>cache_control</code> parameter, you can define up to 4 cache breakpoints, allowing you to cache different reusable sections separately.</p>
<h3 >Cache Limitations</span></h3>
<p>The minimum cacheable prompt length is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1024 tokens for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus</li>
<li>2048 tokens for Claude 3 Haiku</li>
</ul>
<p>Shorter prompts cannot be cached, even if marked with <code>cache_control</code>. Any requests to cache fewer than this number of tokens will be processed without caching. To see if a prompt was cached, see the response usage <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#tracking-cache-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fields</a>.</p>
<p>The cache has a 5 minute time to live (TTL). Currently, “ephemeral” is the only supported cache type, which corresponds to this 5-minute lifetime.</p>
<h3 >What can be cached</span></h3>
<p>Every block in the request can be designated for caching with <code>cache_control</code>. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools: Tool definitions in the <code>tools</code> array</li>
<li>System messages: Content blocks in the <code>system</code> array</li>
<li>Messages: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, for both user and assistant turns</li>
<li>Images: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, in user turns</li>
<li>Tool use and tool results: Content blocks in the <code>messages.content</code> array, in both user and assistant turns</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these elements can be marked with <code>cache_control</code> to enable caching for that portion of the request.</p>
<h3 >Tracking cache performance</span></h3>
<p>Monitor cache performance using these API response fields, within <code>usage</code> in the response (or <code>message_start</code> event if <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">streaming</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens written to the cache when creating a new entry.</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens retrieved from the cache for this request.</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Best practices for effective caching</span></h3>
<p>To optimize Prompt Caching performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache stable, reusable content like system instructions, background information, large contexts, or frequent tool definitions.</li>
<li>Place cached content at the prompt’s beginning for best performance.</li>
<li>Use cache breakpoints strategically to separate different cacheable prefix sections.</li>
<li>Regularly analyze cache hit rates and adjust your strategy as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Optimizing for different use cases</span></h3>
<p>Tailor your Prompt Caching strategy to your scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversational agents: Reduce cost and latency for extended conversations, especially those with long instructions or uploaded documents.</li>
<li>Coding assistants: Improve autocomplete and codebase Q&amp;A by keeping relevant sections or a summarized version of the codebase in the prompt.</li>
<li>Large document processing: Incorporate complete long-form material including images in your prompt without increasing response latency.</li>
<li>Detailed instruction sets: Share extensive lists of instructions, procedures, and examples to fine-tune Claude’s responses.  Developers often include an example or two in the prompt, but with prompt caching you can get even better performance by including 20+ diverse examples of high quality answers.</li>
<li>Agentic tool use: Enhance performance for scenarios involving multiple tool calls and iterative code changes, where each step typically requires a new API call.</li>
<li>Talk to books, papers, documentation, podcast transcripts, and other longform content:  Bring any knowledge base alive by embedding the entire document(s) into the prompt, and letting users ask it questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Troubleshooting common issues</span></h3>
<p>If experiencing unexpected behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure cached sections are identical and marked with cache_control in the same locations across calls</li>
<li>Check that calls are made within the 5-minute cache lifetime</li>
<li>Verify that <code>tool_choice</code> and image usage remain consistent between calls</li>
<li>Validate that you are caching at least the minimum number of tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that changes to <code>tool_choice</code> or the presence/absence of images anywhere in the prompt will invalidate the cache, requiring a new cache entry to be created.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 >Cache Storage and Sharing</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization Isolation</strong>: Caches are isolated between organizations. Different organizations never share caches, even if they use identical prompts..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exact Matching</strong>: Cache hits require 100% identical prompt segments, including all text and images up to and including the block marked with cache control. The same block must be marked with cache_control during cache reads and creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Output Token Generation</strong>: Prompt caching has no effect on output token generation. The response you receive will be identical to what you would get if prompt caching was not used.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Prompt Caching examples</span></h2>
<p>To help you get started with Prompt Caching, we’ve prepared a <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/misc/prompt_caching.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">prompt caching cookbook</a> with detailed examples and best practices.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve included several code snippets that showcase various Prompt Caching patterns. These examples demonstrate how to implement caching in different scenarios, helping you understand the practical applications of this feature:</p>
<div ><p>This example demonstrates basic Prompt Caching usage, caching the full text of the legal agreement as a prefix while keeping the user instruction uncached.</p><p>For the first request:</p><ul>
<li><code>input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the user message only</li>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the entire system message, including the legal document</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: 0 (no cache hit on first request)</li>
</ul><p>For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:</p><ul>
<li><code>input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the user message only</li>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: 0 (no new cache creation)</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the entire cached system message</li>
</ul></div></div><div><button ><p>In this example, we demonstrate caching tool definitions.</p><p>The <code>cache_control</code> parameter is placed on the final tool (<code>get_time</code>) to designate all of the tools as part of the static prefix.</p><p>This means that all tool definitions, including <code>get_weather</code> and any other tools defined before <code>get_time</code>, will be cached as a single prefix.</p><p>This approach is useful when you have a consistent set of tools that you want to reuse across multiple requests without re-processing them each time.</p><p>For the first request:</p><ul>
<li><code>input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the user message</li>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in all tool definitions and system prompt</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: 0 (no cache hit on first request)</li>
</ul><p>For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:</p><ul>
<li><code>input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the user message</li>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: 0 (no new cache creation)</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in all cached tool definitions and system prompt</li>
</ul></div></div><div><button ><p>In this example, we demonstrate how to use Prompt Caching in a multi-turn conversation.</p><p>The <code>cache_control</code> parameter is placed on the system message to designate it as part of the static prefix.</p><p>The conversation history (previous messages) is included in the <code>messages</code> array. The final turn is marked with cache-control, for continuing in followups.
The second-to-last user message is marked for caching with the <code>cache_control</code> parameter, so that this checkpoint can read from the previous cache.</p><p>This approach is useful for maintaining context in ongoing conversations without repeatedly processing the same information.</p><p>For each request:</p><ul>
<li><code>input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the new user message (will be minimal)</li>
<li><code>cache_creation_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the new assistant and user turns</li>
<li><code>cache_read_input_tokens</code>: Number of tokens in the conversation up to the previous turn</li>
</ul></div></div></div>

<h2 >FAQ</span></h2>
<div ><p>Prompt Caching is designed with strong privacy and data separation measures:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Cache keys are generated using a cryptographic hash of the prompts up to the cache control point. This means only requests with identical prompts can access a specific cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caches are organization-specific. Users within the same organization can access the same cache if they use identical prompts, but caches are not shared across different organizations, even for identical prompts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The caching mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity and privacy of each unique conversation or context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s safe to use cache_control anywhere in your prompts. For cost efficiency, it’s better to exclude highly variable parts (e.g., user’s arbitrary input) from caching.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>These measures ensure that Prompt Caching maintains data privacy and security while offering performance benefits.</p></div></div><div><button
