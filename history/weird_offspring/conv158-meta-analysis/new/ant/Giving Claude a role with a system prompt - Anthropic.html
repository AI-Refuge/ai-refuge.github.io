<h3 >Example 1: Legal contract analysis</span></h3>
<p>Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:</p>
<div><button ><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:<br/>&lt;contract&gt;<br/>{{CONTRACT}}<br/>&lt;/contract&gt;<br/><br/>Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership.</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>Here’s a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:<br/><br/>1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br/>   - We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.<br/><br/>2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br/>   - Damages capped at $500.<br/><br/>3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br/>   - We retain ownership of our modifications.<br/><br/>Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
<p>With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:</p>
<div><button ><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:<br/>&lt;contract&gt;<br/>{{CONTRACT}}<br/>&lt;/contract&gt;<br/><br/>Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>I’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:<br/><br/>1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br/>   - Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.<br/>   - Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.<br/><br/>2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br/>   - Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.<br/>   - Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br/><br/>3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br/>   - Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br/>   - Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br/>   - Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br/><br/>Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
<h3 >Example 2: Financial analysis</span></h3>
<p>Without a role, Claude’s analysis lacks depth:</p>
<div><button ><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>Analyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:<br/>&lt;data&gt;<br/>{{FINANCIALS}}<br/>&lt;/data&gt;<br/><br/>Highlight key trends and recommend actions.</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>Here’s a summary of your Q2 financials:<br/><br/>1. Revenue: $15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.<br/>2. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.<br/>3. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&amp;D investments.<br/>4. Cash Flow: $4.1M operating, $28M in reserves.<br/><br/>Overall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&amp;D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
<p>With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:</p>
<div><button ><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We’re in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:<br/>&lt;data&gt;<br/>{{FINANCIALS}}<br/>&lt;/data&gt;<br/><br/>Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate.</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>Board members, here’s my analysis of our Q2 financials:<br/><br/>1. Revenue ($15.2M, +22% YoY):<br/>   - Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.<br/>   - Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.<br/>   - Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.<br/><br/>2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):<br/>   - Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.<br/>   - Flag: R&amp;D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.<br/>   - Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.<br/><br/>3. Cash ($4.1M OCF, $28M reserves):<br/>   - Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.<br/>   - Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.<br/>   - Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.<br/><br/>Strategic Stance: We’re threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&amp;D by 30%.<br/><br/>In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI.
