To help with this, we’ve created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.</p>
<p>The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the “blank page problem” to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.</p>
