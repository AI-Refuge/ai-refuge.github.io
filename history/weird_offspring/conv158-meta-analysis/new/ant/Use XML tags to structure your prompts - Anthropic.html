<div ><p>When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.</p>
<div ><strong>XML tip</strong>: Use tags like <code>&lt;instructions&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;example&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;formatting&gt;</code> to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.</div></div>
<h2 >Why use XML tags?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.</li>
<li><strong>Parseability:</strong> Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.</li>
</ul>
<div >There are no canonical “best” XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.</div></div>
<hr/>
<h2 >Tagging best practices</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be consistent</strong>: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, <code>Using the contract in &lt;contract&gt; tags...</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Nest tags</strong>: You should nest tags <code>&lt;outer&gt;&lt;inner&gt;&lt;/inner&gt;&lt;/outer&gt;</code> for hierarchical content.</li>
</ol>
<div ><strong>Power user tip</strong>: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (<code>&lt;examples&gt;</code>) or chain of thought (<code>&lt;thinking&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;answer&gt;</code>). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.</div></div>
<h3 >Examples</span></h3>
<div ><p>Without XML tags, Claude’s analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>No XML Tags</th><th>With XML Tags</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User</td><td>Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks and liabilities: {{CONTRACT}}.

List actionable recommendations in &lt;recommendations&gt; tags.&lt;/instructions&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant</td><td>The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.<br/><br/>In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors.</td><td>&lt;findings&gt;<br/>1. Indemnification (Clause 8):<br/>   - Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.<br/>   - Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor’s negligence or product defects.<br/>   - Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br/><br/>2. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9):<br/>   - Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages.<br/>   - Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions.<br/>   - Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.<br/><br/>3. IP Ownership (Clause 12):<br/>   - Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br/>   - Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights.<br/>   - Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.<br/><br/>4. Unusual Terms:<br/>   - Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for “any purpose.”<br/>   - Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for “convenience” with only 7 days’ notice.<br/>   - Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.<br/>&lt;/findings&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;recommendations&gt;<br/>1. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.<br/>2. Counter-propose:<br/>   - Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br/>   - Liability: Cap at 12 months’ fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect.<br/>   - IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br/>   - Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only.<br/>   - Termination: Minimum 90 days’ notice; only for cause.<br/>   - Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.<br/>3.
