This is a compilation of the prompt engineering strategies I learned along the way, that push any LLM to do exactly what you need and more!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Authorâ€™s Note:
</strong>In writing this, I sought to steer away from the traditional prompt engineering techniques that have already been extensively discussed and documented online. Instead, my aim is to bring fresh insights that I learned through experimentation, and a different, personal take in understanding and approaching certain techniques. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy reading this piece!</p></blockquote><p><strong>This article covers the following, with </strong>ðŸ”µ <strong>referring to beginner-friendly prompting techniques while </strong>ðŸ”´ <strong>refers to advanced strategies:</strong></p></section></article></body></html>
